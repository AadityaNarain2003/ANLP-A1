### How to Clean 'Auguste_Maquet'

- Manual Cleaning - That is removing unnecessary prefaces, publisher's content, Index and other things not relevant to the chapter
- Run Sentences_Generator.py - This will generate all the sentences in this book
- Run Csv_generator and to_6_worded_csv to create a 6 worded csv file

### Where will these files be used

- In Question 1, the csv file will be used
- In Question 2 and 3, the sentences file will be used
- test_csv and test_sentences will be used to train stuff locally ( 1000 lines in both )
