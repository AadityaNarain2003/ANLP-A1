In,a,splendid,chamber,of,the,Palais,Royal,formerly,styled,the,Palais,Cardinal,a,man,was,sitting,in,deep,reverie,his,head,supported,on,his,hands,leaning,over,a,gilt,and,inlaid,table,which,was,covered,with,letters,and,papers
Behind,this,figure,glowed,a,vast,fireplace,alive,with,leaping,flames,great,logs,of,oak,blazed,and,crackled,on,the,polished,brass,andirons,whose,flicker,shone,upon,the,superb,habiliments,of,the,lonely,tenant,of,the,room,which,was,illumined,grandly,by,twin,candelabra,rich,with,waxlights
Any,one,who,happened,at,that,moment,to,contemplate,that,red,simarthe,gorgeous,robe,of,officeand,the,rich,lace,or,who,gazed,on,that,pale,brow,bent,in,anxious,meditation,might,in,the,solitude,of,that,apartment,combined,with,the,silence,of,the,antechambers,and,the,measured,paces,of,the,guards,upon,the,landingplace,have,fancied,that,the,shade,of,Cardinal,Richelieu,lingered,still,in,his,accustomed,haunt
France,enfeebled,the,authority,of,her,sovereign,contemned,her,nobles,returning,to,their,former,turbulence,and,insolence,her,enemies,within,her,frontiersall,proved,the,great,Richelieu,no,longer,in,existence
In,truth,that,the,red,simar,which,occupied,the,wonted,place,was,his,no,longer,was,still,more,strikingly,obvious,from,the,isolation,which,seemed,as,we,have,observed,more,appropriate,to,a,phantom,than,a,living,creaturefrom,the,corridors,deserted,by,courtiers,and,courts,crowded,with,guardsfrom,that,spirit,of,bitter,ridicule,which,arising,from,the,streets,below,penetrated,through,the,very,casements,of,the,room,which,resounded,with,the,murmurs,of,a,whole,city,leagued,against,the,minister,as,well,as,from,the,distant,and,incessant,sounds,of,guns,firinglet,off,happily,without,other,end,or,aim,except,to,show,to,the,guards,the,Swiss,troops,and,the,military,who,surrounded,the,Palais,Royal,that,the,people,were,possessed,of,arms
The,shade,of,Richelieu,was,Mazarin
Now,Mazarin,was,alone,and,defenceless,as,he,well,knew
that,is,their,mean,yet,mighty,byword,of,reproachthe,watchword,with,which,they,assassinated,hanged,and,made,away,with,Concini,and,if,I,gave,them,their,way,they,would,assassinate,hang,and,make,away,with,me,in,the,same,manner,although,they,have,nothing,to,complain,of,except,a,tax,or,two,now,and,then
ignorant,of,their,real,enemies,they,do,not,perceive,that,it,is,not,the,Italian,who,speaks,French,badly,but,those,who,can,say,fine,things,to,them,in,the,purest,Parisian,accent,who,are,their,real,foes
Yes,yes,Mazarin,continued,whilst,his,wonted,smile,full,of,subtlety,lent,a,strange,expression,to,his,pale,lips,yes,these,noises,prove,to,me,indeed,that,the,destiny,of,favorites,is,precarious,but,ye,shall,know,I,am,no,ordinary,favorite
The,Earl,of,Essex,tis,true,wore,a,splendid,ring,set,with,diamonds,given,him,by,his,royal,mistress,whilst,II,have,nothing,but,a,simple,circlet,of,gold,with,a,cipher,on,it,and,a,date,but,that,ring,has,been,blessed,in,the,chapel,of,the,Palais,Royal,so,they,will,never,ruin,me,as,they,long,to,do,and,whilst,they,shout,Down,with,Mazarin,I,unknown,and,unperceived,by,them,incite,them,to,cry,out,Long,live,the,Duke,de,Beaufort,one,day,another,Long,live,the,Prince,de,Conde,and,again,Long,live,the,parliament,And,at,this,word,the,smile,on,the,cardinals,lips,assumed,an,expression,of,hatred,of,which,his,mild,countenance,seemed,incapable
We,shall,soon,see,how,to,dispose,he,continued,of,the,parliament
Both,Orleans,and,Montargis,are,ours
It,will,be,a,work,of,time,but,those,who,have,begun,by,crying,out,Down,with,Mazarin
will,finish,by,shouting,out,Down,with,all,the,people,I,have,mentioned,each,in,his,turn
It,is,said,that,Mazarin,who,though,a,cardinal,had,not,taken,such,vows,as,to,prevent,it,was,secretly,married,to,Anne,of,AustriaLa,Portes,Memoirs
Richelieu,whom,they,hated,during,his,lifetime,and,whom,they,now,praise,after,his,death,was,even,less,popular,than,I,am
Often,he,was,driven,away,oftener,still,had,he,a,dread,of,being,sent,away
The,queen,will,never,banish,me,and,even,were,I,obliged,to,yield,to,the,populace,she,would,yield,with,me,if,I,fly,she,will,fly,and,then,we,shall,see,how,the,rebels,will,get,on,without,either,king,or,queen
Oh,were,I,not,a,foreigner
were,I,but,of,gentle,birth,The,position,of,the,cardinal,was,indeed,critical,and,recent,events,had,added,to,his,difficulties
Discontent,had,long,pervaded,the,lower,ranks,of,society,in,France
Crushed,and,impoverished,by,taxationimposed,by,Mazarin,whose,avarice,impelled,him,to,grind,them,down,to,the,very,dustthe,people,as,the,AdvocateGeneral,Talon,described,it,had,nothing,left,to,them,except,their,souls,and,as,those,could,not,be,sold,by,auction,they,began,to,murmur
Patience,had,in,vain,been,recommended,to,them,by,reports,of,brilliant,victories,gained,by,France,laurels,however,were,not,meat,and,drink,and,the,people,had,for,some,time,been,in,a,state,of,discontent
Had,this,been,all,it,might,not,perhaps,have,greatly,signified,for,when,the,lower,classes,alone,complained,the,court,of,France,separated,as,it,was,from,the,poor,by,the,intervening,classes,of,the,gentry,and,the,_bourgeoisie_,seldom,listened,to,their,voice,but,unluckily,Mazarin,had,had,the,imprudence,to,attack,the,magistrates,and,had,sold,no,less,than,twelve,appointments,in,the,Court,of,Requests,at,a,high,price,and,as,the,officers,of,that,court,paid,very,dearly,for,their,places,and,as,the,addition,of,twelve,new,colleagues,would,necessarily,lower,the,value,of,each,place,the,old,functionaries,formed,a,union,amongst,themselves,and,enraged,swore,on,the,Bible,not,to,allow,of,this,addition,to,their,number,but,to,resist,all,the,persecutions,which,might,ensue,and,should,any,one,of,them,chance,to,forfeit,his,post,by,this,resistance,to,combine,to,indemnify,him,for,his,loss
Now,the,following,occurrences,had,taken,place,between,the,two,contending,parties
On,the,seventh,of,January,between,seven,and,eight,hundred,tradesmen,had,assembled,in,Paris,to,discuss,a,new,tax,which,was,to,be,levied,on,house,property
They,deputed,ten,of,their,number,to,wait,upon,the,Duke,of,Orleans,who,according,to,his,custom,affected,popularity
The,duke,received,them,and,they,informed,him,that,they,were,resolved,not,to,pay,this,tax,even,if,they,were,obliged,to,defend,themselves,against,its,collectors,by,force,of,arms
They,were,listened,to,with,great,politeness,by,the,duke,who,held,out,hopes,of,easier,measures,promised,to,speak,in,their,behalf,to,the,queen,and,dismissed,them,with,the,ordinary,expression,of,royalty,We,will,see,what,we,can,do,Two,days,afterward,these,same,magistrates,appeared,before,the,cardinal,and,their,spokesman,addressed,Mazarin,with,so,much,fearlessness,and,determination,that,the,minister,was,astounded,and,sent,the,deputation,away,with,the,same,answer,as,it,had,received,from,the,Duke,of,Orleansthat,he,would,see,what,could,be,done,and,in,accordance,with,that,intention,a,council,of,state,was,assembled,and,the,superintendent,of,finance,was,summoned
This,man,named,Emery,was,the,object,of,popular,detestation,in,the,first,place,because,he,_was_,superintendent,of,finance,and,every,superintendent,of,finance,deserved,to,be,hated,in,the,second,place,because,he,rather,deserved,the,odium,which,he,had,incurred
He,was,the,son,of,a,banker,at,Lyons,named,Particelli,who,after,becoming,a,bankrupt,chose,to,change,his,name,to,Emery,and,Cardinal,Richelieu,having,discovered,in,him,great,financial,aptitude,had,introduced,him,with,a,strong,recommendation,to,Louis,XIII
under,his,assumed,name,in,order,that,he,might,be,appointed,to,the,post,he,subsequently,held
You,surprise,me,exclaimed,the,monarch
I,am,rejoiced,to,hear,you,speak,of,Monsieur,dEmery,as,calculated,for,a,post,which,requires,a,man,of,probity
I,was,really,afraid,that,you,were,going,to,force,that,villain,Particelli,upon,me,Sire,replied,Richelieu,rest,assured,that,Particelli,the,man,to,whom,your,majesty,refers,has,been,hanged,Ah,so,much,the,better,exclaimed,the,king
It,is,not,for,nothing,that,I,am,styled,Louis,the,Just,and,he,signed,Emerys,appointment
This,was,the,same,Emery,who,became,eventually,superintendent,of,finance
He,was,sent,for,by,the,ministers,and,he,came,before,them,pale,and,trembling,declaring,that,his,son,had,very,nearly,been,assassinated,the,day,before,near,the,palace
The,mob,had,insulted,him,on,account,of,the,ostentatious,luxury,of,his,wife,whose,house,was,hung,with,red,velvet,edged,with,gold,fringe
This,lady,was,the,daughter,of,Nicholas,de,Camus,who,arrived,in,Paris,with,twenty,francs,in,his,pocket,became,secretary,of,state,and,accumulated,wealth,enough,to,divide,nine,millions,of,francs,among,his,children,and,to,keep,an,income,of,forty,thousand,for,himself
The,fact,was,that,Emerys,son,had,run,a,great,chance,of,being,suffocated,one,of,the,rioters,having,proposed,to,squeeze,him,until,he,gave,up,all,the,gold,he,had,swallowed
Nothing,therefore,was,settled,that,day,as,Emerys,head,was,not,steady,enough,for,business,after,such,an,occurrence
On,the,next,day,Mathieu,Molé,the,chief,president,whose,courage,at,this,crisis,says,the,Cardinal,de,Retz,was,equal,to,that,of,the,Duc,de,Beaufort,and,the,Prince,de,Condéin,other,words,of,the,two,men,who,were,considered,the,bravest,in,Francehad,been,attacked,in,his,turn
The,people,threatened,to,hold,him,responsible,for,the,evils,that,hung,over,them
But,the,chief,president,had,replied,with,his,habitual,coolness,without,betraying,either,disturbance,or,surprise,that,should,the,agitators,refuse,obedience,to,the,kings,wishes,he,would,have,gallows,erected,in,the,public,squares,and,proceed,at,once,to,hang,the,most,active,among,them
To,which,the,others,had,responded,that,they,would,be,glad,to,see,the,gallows,erected,they,would,serve,for,the,hanging,of,those,detestable,judges,who,purchased,favor,at,court,at,the,price,of,the,peoples,misery
On,the,eleventh,the,queen,in,going,to,mass,at,Notre,Dame,as,she,always,did,on,Saturdays,was,followed,by,more,than,two,hundred,women,demanding,justice
These,poor,creatures,had,no,bad,intentions
They,wished,only,to,be,allowed,to,fall,on,their,knees,before,their,sovereign,and,that,they,might,move,her,to,compassion,but,they,were,prevented,by,the,royal,guard,and,the,queen,proceeded,on,her,way,haughtily,disdainful,of,their,entreaties
At,length,parliament,was,convoked,the,authority,of,the,king,was,to,be,maintained
One,dayit,was,the,morning,of,the,day,my,story,beginsthe,king,Louis,XIV,then,ten,years,of,age,went,in,state,under,pretext,of,returning,thanks,for,his,recovery,from,the,smallpox,to,Notre,Dame
He,took,the,opportunity,of,calling,out,his,guard,the,Swiss,troops,and,the,musketeers,and,he,had,planted,them,round,the,Palais,Royal,on,the,quays,and,on,the,Pont,Neuf
After,mass,the,young,monarch,drove,to,the,Parliament,House,where,upon,the,throne,he,hastily,confirmed,not,only,such,edicts,as,he,had,already,passed,but,issued,new,ones,each,one,according,to,Cardinal,de,Retz,more,ruinous,than,the,othersa,proceeding,which,drew,forth,a,strong,remonstrance,from,the,chief,president,Moléwhilst,President,Blancmesnil,and,Councillor,Broussel,raised,their,voices,in,indignation,against,fresh,taxes
The,king,returned,amidst,the,silence,of,a,vast,multitude,to,the,Palais,Royal
All,minds,were,uneasy,most,were,foreboding,many,of,the,people,used,threatening,language
At,first,indeed,they,were,doubtful,whether,the,kings,visit,to,the,parliament,had,been,in,order,to,lighten,or,increase,their,burdens,but,scarcely,was,it,known,that,the,taxes,were,to,be,still,further,increased,when,cries,of,Down,with,Mazarin,Long,live,Broussel,Long,live,Blancmesnil,resounded,through,the,city
For,the,people,had,learned,that,Broussel,and,Blancmesnil,had,made,speeches,in,their,behalf,and,although,the,eloquence,of,these,deputies,had,been,without,avail,it,had,none,the,less,won,for,them,the,peoples,goodwill
All,attempts,to,disperse,the,groups,collected,in,the,streets,or,silence,their,exclamations,were,in,vain
Orders,had,just,been,given,to,the,royal,guards,and,the,Swiss,guards,not,only,to,stand,firm,but,to,send,out,patrols,to,the,streets,of,Saint,Denis,and,Saint,Martin,where,the,people,thronged,and,where,they,were,the,most,vociferous,when,the,mayor,of,Paris,was,announced,at,the,Palais,Royal
He,was,shown,in,directly,he,came,to,say,that,if,these,offensive,precautions,were,not,discontinued,in,two,hours,Paris,would,be,under,arms
Deliberations,were,being,held,when,a,lieutenant,in,the,guards,named,Comminges,made,his,appearance,with,his,clothes,all,torn,his,face,streaming,with,blood
The,queen,on,seeing,him,uttered,a,cry,of,surprise,and,asked,him,what,was,going,on
As,the,mayor,had,foreseen,the,sight,of,the,guards,had,exasperated,the,mob
Comminges,had,arrested,one,of,the,ringleaders,and,had,ordered,him,to,be,hanged,near,the,cross,of,Du,Trahoir,but,in,attempting,to,execute,this,command,the,soldiery,were,attacked,in,the,marketplace,with,stones,and,halberds,the,delinquent,had,escaped,to,the,Rue,des,Lombards,and,rushed,into,a,house
They,broke,open,the,doors,and,searched,the,dwelling,but,in,vain
Comminges,wounded,by,a,stone,which,had,struck,him,on,the,forehead,had,left,a,picket,in,the,street,and,returned,to,the,Palais,Royal,followed,by,a,menacing,crowd,to,tell,his,story
This,account,confirmed,that,of,the,mayor
The,authorities,were,not,in,a,condition,to,cope,with,serious,revolt
Mazarin,endeavored,to,circulate,among,the,people,a,report,that,troops,had,only,been,stationed,on,the,quays,and,on,the,Pont,Neuf,on,account,of,the,ceremonial,of,the,day,and,that,they,would,soon,withdraw
In,fact,about,four,oclock,they,were,all,concentrated,about,the,Palais,Royal,the,courts,and,ground,floors,of,which,were,filled,with,musketeers,and,Swiss,guards,and,there,awaited,the,outcome,of,all,this,disturbance
Such,was,the,state,of,affairs,at,the,very,moment,we,introduced,our,readers,to,the,study,of,Cardinal,Mazarinonce,that,of,Cardinal,Richelieu
We,have,seen,in,what,state,of,mind,he,listened,to,the,murmurs,from,below,which,even,reached,him,in,his,seclusion,and,to,the,guns,the,firing,of,which,resounded,through,that,room
All,at,once,he,raised,his,head,his,brow,slightly,contracted,like,that,of,a,man,who,has,formed,a,resolution,he,fixed,his,eyes,upon,an,enormous,clock,that,was,about,to,strike,ten,and,taking,up,a,whistle,of,silver,gilt,that,stood,upon,the,table,near,him,he,shrilled,it,twice
A,door,hidden,in,the,tapestry,opened,noiselessly,and,a,man,in,black,silently,advanced,and,stood,behind,the,chair,on,which,Mazarin,sat
Bernouin,said,the,cardinal,not,turning,round,for,having,whistled,he,knew,that,it,was,his,_valetdechambre_,who,was,behind,him,what,musketeers,are,now,within,the,palace,The,Black,Musketeers,my,lord,What,company,Trévilles,company,Is,there,any,officer,belonging,to,this,company,in,the,antechamber,Lieutenant,dArtagnan,A,man,on,whom,we,can,depend,I,hope,Yes,my,lord,Give,me,a,uniform,of,one,of,these,musketeers,and,help,me,to,put,it,on,The,valet,went,out,as,silently,as,he,had,entered,and,appeared,in,a,few,minutes,bringing,the,dress,demanded
The,cardinal,in,deep,thought,and,in,silence,began,to,take,off,the,robes,of,state,he,had,assumed,in,order,to,be,present,at,the,sitting,of,parliament,and,to,attire,himself,in,the,military,coat,which,he,wore,with,a,certain,degree,of,easy,grace,owing,to,his,former,campaigns,in,Italy
When,he,was,completely,dressed,he,said,Send,hither,Monsieur,dArtagnan,The,valet,went,out,of,the,room,this,time,by,the,centre,door,but,still,as,silently,as,before,one,might,have,fancied,him,an,apparition
When,he,was,left,alone,the,cardinal,looked,at,himself,in,the,glass,with,a,feeling,of,selfsatisfaction
Still,youngfor,he,was,scarcely,fortysix,years,of,agehe,possessed,great,elegance,of,form,and,was,above,the,middle,height,his,complexion,was,brilliant,and,beautiful,his,glance,full,of,expression,his,nose,though,large,was,well,proportioned,his,forehead,broad,and,majestic,his,hair,of,a,chestnut,color,was,curled,slightly,his,beard,which,was,darker,than,his,hair,was,turned,carefully,with,a,curling,iron,a,practice,that,greatly,improved,it
After,a,short,time,the,cardinal,arranged,his,shoulder,belt,then,looked,with,great,complacency,at,his,hands,which,were,most,elegant,and,of,which,he,took,the,greatest,care,and,throwing,on,one,side,the,large,kid,gloves,tried,on,at,first,as,belonging,to,the,uniform,he,put,on,others,of,silk,only
At,this,instant,the,door,opened
An,officer,as,he,spoke,entered,the,apartment
He,was,a,man,between,thirtynine,and,forty,years,of,age,of,medium,height,but,a,very,well,proportioned,figure,with,an,intellectual,and,animated,physiognomy,his,beard,black,and,his,hair,turning,gray,as,often,happens,when,people,have,found,life,either,too,gay,or,too,sad,more,especially,when,they,happen,to,be,of,swart,complexion
DArtagnan,advanced,a,few,steps,into,the,apartment
How,perfectly,he,remembered,his,former,entrance,into,that,very,room
Seeing,however,no,one,there,except,a,musketeer,of,his,own,troop,he,fixed,his,eyes,upon,the,supposed,soldier,in,whose,dress,nevertheless,he,recognized,at,the,first,glance,the,cardinal
The,lieutenant,remained,standing,in,a,dignified,but,respectful,posture,such,as,became,a,man,of,good,birth,who,had,in,the,course,of,his,life,been,frequently,in,the,society,of,the,highest,nobles
The,cardinal,looked,at,him,with,a,cunning,rather,than,serious,glance,yet,he,examined,his,countenance,with,attention,and,after,a,momentary,silence,said,You,are,Monsieur,dArtagnan,I,am,that,individual,replied,the,officer
Mazarin,gazed,once,more,at,a,countenance,full,of,intelligence,the,play,of,which,had,been,nevertheless,subdued,by,age,and,experience,and,DArtagnan,received,the,penetrating,glance,like,one,who,had,formerly,sustained,many,a,searching,look,very,different,indeed,from,those,which,were,inquiringly,directed,on,him,at,that,instant
Sir,resumed,the,cardinal,you,are,to,come,with,me,or,rather,I,am,to,go,with,you,I,am,at,your,command,my,lord,returned,DArtagnan
I,wish,to,visit,in,person,the,outposts,which,surround,the,Palais,Royal,do,you,suppose,that,there,is,any,danger,in,so,doing,Danger,my,lord,exclaimed,DArtagnan,with,a,look,of,astonishment,what,danger,I,am,told,that,there,is,a,general,insurrection,The,uniform,of,the,kings,musketeers,carries,a,certain,respect,with,it,and,even,if,that,were,not,the,case,I,would,engage,with,four,of,my,men,to,put,to,flight,a,hundred,of,these,clowns,Did,you,witness,the,injury,sustained,by,Comminges,Monsieur,de,Comminges,is,in,the,guards,and,not,in,the,musketeers,Which,means,I,suppose,that,the,musketeers,are,better,soldiers,than,the,guards,The,cardinal,smiled,as,he,spoke
Every,one,likes,his,own,uniform,best,my,lord,Myself,excepted,and,again,Mazarin,smiled,for,you,perceive,that,I,have,left,off,mine,and,put,on,yours,Lord,bless,us

Had,I,such,a,uniform,as,your,eminence,possesses,I,protest,I,should,be,mightily,content,and,I,would,take,an,oath,never,to,wear,any,other,costume,Yes,but,for,tonights,adventure,I,dont,suppose,my,dress,would,have,been,a,very,safe,one
Give,me,my,felt,hat,Bernouin,The,valet,instantly,brought,to,his,master,a,regimental,hat,with,a,wide,brim

This,waylight,us,downstairs,Bernouin,The,valet,held,a,waxlight,the,cardinal,took,a,key,from,his,bureau,and,opening,the,door,of,a,secret,stair,descended,into,the,court,of,the,Palais,Royal
In,ten,minutes,Mazarin,and,his,party,were,traversing,the,street,Les,Bons,Enfants,behind,the,theatre,built,by,Richelieu,expressly,for,the,play,of,Mirame,and,in,which,Mazarin,who,was,an,amateur,of,music,but,not,of,literature,had,introduced,into,France,the,first,opera,that,was,ever,acted,in,that,country
The,appearance,of,the,town,denoted,the,greatest,agitation
Numberless,groups,paraded,the,streets,and,whatever,DArtagnan,might,think,of,it,it,was,obvious,that,the,citizens,had,for,the,night,laid,aside,their,usual,forbearance,in,order,to,assume,a,warlike,aspect
From,time,to,time,noises,came,in,the,direction,of,the,public,markets
The,report,of,firearms,was,heard,near,the,Rue,Saint,Denis,and,occasionally,church,bells,began,to,ring,indiscriminately,and,at,the,caprice,of,the,populace
DArtagnan,meantime,pursued,his,way,with,the,indifference,of,a,man,upon,whom,such,acts,of,folly,made,no,impression
When,he,approached,a,group,in,the,middle,of,the,street,he,urged,his,horse,upon,it,without,a,word,of,warning,and,the,members,of,the,group,whether,rebels,or,not,as,if,they,knew,with,what,sort,of,a,man,they,had,to,deal,at,once,gave,place,to,the,patrol
The,cardinal,envied,that,composure,which,he,attributed,to,the,habit,of,meeting,danger,but,none,the,less,he,conceived,for,the,officer,under,whose,orders,he,had,for,the,moment,placed,himself,that,consideration,which,even,prudence,pays,to,careless,courage
On,approaching,an,outpost,near,the,Barriere,des,Sergens,the,sentinel,cried,out,Whos,there,and,DArtagnan,answeredhaving,first,asked,the,word,of,the,cardinalLouis,and,Rocroy,After,which,he,inquired,if,Lieutenant,Comminges,were,not,the,commanding,officer,at,the,outpost
The,soldier,replied,by,pointing,out,to,him,an,officer,who,was,conversing,on,foot,his,hand,upon,the,neck,of,a,horse,on,which,the,individual,to,whom,he,was,talking,sat
Here,was,the,officer,DArtagnan,was,seeking
Here,is,Monsieur,Comminges,said,DArtagnan,returning,to,the,cardinal
He,instantly,retired,from,a,feeling,of,respectful,delicacy,it,was,however,evident,that,the,cardinal,was,recognized,by,both,Comminges,and,the,other,officers,on,horseback
Well,done,Guitant,cried,the,cardinal,to,the,equestrian,I,see,plainly,that,notwithstanding,the,sixtyfour,years,that,have,passed,over,your,head,you,are,still,the,same,man,active,and,zealous
What,were,you,saying,to,this,youngster,My,lord,replied,Guitant,I,was,observing,that,we,live,in,troublous,times,and,that,todays,events,are,very,like,those,in,the,days,of,the,Ligue,of,which,I,heard,so,much,in,my,youth
Are,you,aware,that,the,mob,have,even,suggested,throwing,up,barricades,in,the,Rue,Saint,Denis,and,the,Rue,Saint,Antoine,And,what,was,Comminges,saying,to,you,in,reply,my,good,Guitant,My,lord,said,Comminges,I,answered,that,to,compose,a,Ligue,only,one,ingredient,was,wantingin,my,opinion,an,essential,onea,Duc,de,Guise,moreover,no,generation,ever,does,the,same,thing,twice,No,but,they,mean,to,make,a,Fronde,as,they,call,it,said,Guitant
And,what,is,a,Fronde,inquired,Mazarin
My,lord,Fronde,is,the,name,the,discontented,give,to,their,party,And,what,is,the,origin,of,this,name,It,seems,that,some,days,since,Councillor,Bachaumont,remarked,at,the,palace,that,rebels,and,agitators,reminded,him,of,schoolboys,slingingqui,frondentstones,from,the,moats,round,Paris,young,urchins,who,run,off,the,moment,the,constable,appears,only,to,return,to,their,diversion,the,instant,his,back,is,turned
So,they,have,picked,up,the,word,and,the,insurrectionists,are,called,Frondeurs,and,yesterday,every,article,sold,was,a,la,Fronde,bread,a,la,Fronde,hats,a,la,Fronde,to,say,nothing,of,gloves,pockethandkerchiefs,and,fans,but,listen,At,that,moment,a,window,opened,and,a,man,began,to,sing,A,tempest,from,the,Fronde,Did,blow,today,I,think,twill,blow,Sieur,Mazarin,away,Insolent,wretch,cried,Guitant
My,lord,said,Comminges,who,irritated,by,his,wounds,wished,for,revenge,and,longed,to,give,back,blow,for,blow,shall,I,fire,off,a,ball,to,punish,that,jester,and,to,warn,him,not,to,sing,so,much,out,of,tune,in,the,future,And,as,he,spoke,he,put,his,hand,on,the,holster,of,his,uncles,saddlebow
my,dear,friend,you,are,going,to,spoil,everythingeverything,is,going,on,famously
I,know,the,French,as,well,as,if,I,had,made,them,myself
They,singlet,them,pay,the,piper
During,the,Ligue,about,which,Guitant,was,speaking,just,now,the,people,chanted,nothing,except,the,mass,so,everything,went,to,destruction
Come,Guitant,come,along,and,lets,see,if,they,keep,watch,at,the,QuinzeVingts,as,at,the,Barriere,des,Sergens,And,waving,his,hand,to,Comminges,he,rejoined,DArtagnan,who,instantly,put,himself,at,the,head,of,his,troop,followed,by,the,cardinal,Guitant,and,the,rest,of,the,escort
Just,so,muttered,Comminges,looking,after,Mazarin
True,I,forgot,provided,he,can,get,money,out,of,the,people,that,is,all,he,wants,The,street,of,Saint,Honore,when,the,cardinal,and,his,party,passed,through,it,was,crowded,by,an,assemblage,who,standing,in,groups,discussed,the,edicts,of,that,memorable,day
They,pitied,the,young,king,who,was,unconsciously,ruining,his,country,and,threw,all,the,odium,of,his,proceedings,on,Mazarin
Addresses,to,the,Duke,of,Orleans,and,to,Condé,were,suggested
Blancmesnil,and,Broussel,seemed,in,the,highest,favor
DArtagnan,passed,through,the,very,midst,of,this,discontented,mob,just,as,if,his,horse,and,he,had,been,made,of,iron
Mazarin,and,Guitant,conversed,together,in,whispers
The,musketeers,who,had,already,discovered,who,Mazarin,was,followed,in,profound,silence
In,the,street,of,Saint,ThomasduLouvre,they,stopped,at,the,barrier,distinguished,by,the,name,of,QuinzeVingts
Here,Guitant,spoke,to,one,of,the,subalterns,asking,how,matters,were,progressing
Ah,captain,said,the,officer,everything,is,quiet,hereaboutif,I,did,not,know,that,something,is,going,on,in,yonder,house,And,he,pointed,to,a,magnificent,hotel,situated,on,the,very,spot,whereon,the,Vaudeville,now,stands
it,is,the,Hotel,Rambouillet,cried,Guitant
I,really,dont,know,what,hotel,it,is,all,I,do,know,is,that,I,observed,some,suspicious,looking,people,go,in,there,Nonsense,exclaimed,Guitant,with,a,burst,of,laughter,those,men,must,be,poets,Come,Guitant,speak,if,you,please,respectfully,of,these,gentlemen,said,Mazarin,dont,you,know,that,I,was,in,my,youth,a,poet
I,wrote,verses,in,the,style,of,Benserade,You,my,lord,Yes,I,shall,I,repeat,to,you,some,of,my,verses,Just,as,you,please,my,lord
I,do,not,understand,Italian,Yes,but,you,understand,French,and,Mazarin,laid,his,hand,upon,Guitants,shoulder
My,good,my,brave,Guitant,whatsoever,command,I,may,give,you,in,that,languagein,Frenchwhatever,I,may,order,you,to,do,will,you,not,perform,it,Certainly
I,have,already,answered,that,question,in,the,affirmative,but,that,command,must,come,from,the,queen,herself,Yes
ah,yes,Mazarin,bit,his,lips,as,he,spoke,I,know,your,devotion,to,her,majesty,I,have,been,a,captain,in,the,queens,guards,for,twenty,years,was,the,reply
En,route,Monsieur,dArtagnan,said,the,cardinal,all,goes,well,in,this,direction,DArtagnan,in,the,meantime,had,taken,the,head,of,his,detachment,without,a,word,and,with,that,ready,and,profound,obedience,which,marks,the,character,of,an,old,soldier
He,led,the,way,toward,the,hill,of,Saint,Roche
The,Rue,Richelieu,and,the,Rue,Villedot,were,then,owing,to,their,vicinity,to,the,ramparts,less,frequented,than,any,others,in,that,direction,for,the,town,was,thinly,inhabited,thereabout
Who,is,in,command,here,asked,the,cardinal
Speak,to,him,yourself,for,ever,since,you,were,deputed,by,me,to,arrest,the,Duc,de,Beaufort,this,officer,and,I,have,been,on,bad,terms
He,laid,claim,to,that,honor,as,captain,of,the,royal,guards,I,am,aware,of,that,and,I,have,told,him,a,hundred,times,that,he,was,wrong
The,king,could,not,give,that,order,since,at,that,time,he,was,hardly,four,years,old,Yes,but,I,could,give,him,the,orderI,Guitantand,I,preferred,to,give,it,to,you,Guitant,without,reply,rode,forward,and,desired,the,sentinel,to,call,Monsieur,de,Villequier
so,you,are,here,cried,the,officer,in,the,tone,of,illhumor,habitual,to,him,what,the,devil,are,you,doing,here,I,wish,to,knowcan,you,tell,me,prayis,anything,fresh,occurring,in,this,part,of,the,town,What,do,you,mean
People,cry,out,Long,live,the,king
down,with,Mazarin,Thats,nothing,new,no,weve,been,used,to,those,acclamations,for,some,time,And,you,sing,chorus,replied,Guitant,laughing
Faith,Ive,half,a,mind,to,do,it
In,my,opinion,the,people,are,right,and,cheerfully,would,I,give,up,five,years,of,my,paywhich,I,am,never,paid,by,the,wayto,make,the,king,five,years,older,Really
And,pray,what,would,come,to,pass,supposing,the,king,were,five,years,older,than,he,is,As,soon,as,ever,the,king,comes,of,age,he,will,issue,his,commands,himself,and,tis,far,pleasanter,to,obey,the,grandson,of,Henry,IV
than,the,son,of,Peter,Mazarin
I,would,die,willingly,for,the,king,but,supposing,I,happened,to,be,killed,on,account,of,Mazarin,as,your,nephew,came,near,being,today,there,could,be,nothing,in,Paradise,however,well,placed,I,might,be,there,that,could,console,me,for,it,Well,well,Monsieur,de,Villequier,Mazarin,interposed,I,shall,make,it,my,care,the,king,hears,of,your,loyalty
Come,gentlemen,addressing,the,troop,let,us,return,Stop,exclaimed,Villequier,so,Mazarin,was,here
I,have,been,waiting,for,a,long,time,to,tell,him,what,I,think,of,him
I,am,obliged,to,you,Guitant,although,your,intention,was,perhaps,not,very,favorable,to,me,for,such,an,opportunity,He,turned,away,and,went,off,to,his,post,whistling,a,tune,then,popular,among,the,party,called,the,Fronde,whilst,Mazarin,returned,in,a,pensive,mood,toward,the,Palais,Royal
All,that,he,had,heard,from,these,three,different,men,Comminges,Guitant,and,Villequier,confirmed,him,in,his,conviction,that,in,case,of,serious,tumults,there,would,be,no,one,on,his,side,except,the,queen,and,then,Anne,of,Austria,had,so,often,deserted,her,friends,that,her,support,seemed,most,precarious
During,the,whole,of,this,nocturnal,ride,during,the,whole,time,that,he,was,endeavoring,to,understand,the,various,characters,of,Comminges,Guitant,and,Villequier,Mazarin,was,in,truth,studying,more,especially,one,man
This,man,who,had,remained,immovable,as,bronze,when,menaced,by,the,mobnot,a,muscle,of,whose,face,was,stirred,either,at,Mazarins,witticisms,or,by,the,jests,of,the,multitudeseemed,to,the,cardinal,a,peculiar,being,who,having,participated,in,past,events,similar,to,those,now,occurring,was,calculated,to,cope,with,those,now,on,the,eve,of,taking,place
The,name,of,DArtagnan,was,not,altogether,new,to,Mazarin,who,although,he,did,not,arrive,in,France,before,the,year,1634,or,1635,that,is,to,say,about,eight,or,nine,years,after,the,events,which,we,have,related,in,a,preceding,narrative,fancied,he,had,heard,it,pronounced,as,that,of,one,who,was,said,to,be,a,model,of,courage,address,and,loyalty
The,Three,Musketeers,Possessed,by,this,idea,the,cardinal,resolved,to,know,all,about,DArtagnan,immediately,of,course,he,could,not,inquire,from,DArtagnan,himself,who,he,was,and,what,had,been,his,career,he,remarked,however,in,the,course,of,conversation,that,the,lieutenant,of,musketeers,spoke,with,a,Gascon,accent
Now,the,Italians,and,the,Gascons,are,too,much,alike,and,know,each,other,too,well,ever,to,trust,what,any,one,of,them,may,say,of,himself,so,in,reaching,the,walls,which,surrounded,the,Palais,Royal,the,cardinal,knocked,at,a,little,door,and,after,thanking,DArtagnan,and,requesting,him,to,wait,in,the,court,of,the,Palais,Royal,he,made,a,sign,to,Guitant,to,follow,him
They,both,dismounted,consigned,their,horses,to,the,lackey,who,had,opened,the,door,and,disappeared,in,the,garden
My,dear,friend,said,the,cardinal,leaning,as,they,walked,through,the,garden,on,his,friends,arm,you,told,me,just,now,that,you,had,been,twenty,years,in,the,queens,service,Yes,its,true
Now,my,dear,Guitant,I,have,often,remarked,that,in,addition,to,your,courage,which,is,indisputable,and,your,fidelity,which,is,invincible,you,possess,an,admirable,memory,You,have,found,that,out,have,you,my,lord
Deuce,take,itall,the,worse,for,me,How,There,is,no,doubt,but,that,one,of,the,chief,accomplishments,of,a,courtier,is,to,know,when,to,forget,But,you,Guitant,are,not,a,courtier
You,are,a,brave,soldier,one,of,the,few,remaining,veterans,of,the,days,of,Henry,IV
how,few,today,exist,Plague,ont,my,lord,have,you,brought,me,here,to,get,my,horoscope,out,of,me,No,I,only,brought,you,here,to,ask,you,returned,Mazarin,smiling,if,you,have,taken,any,particular,notice,of,our,lieutenant,of,musketeers,Monsieur,dArtagnan
I,have,had,no,occasion,to,notice,him,particularly,hes,an,old,acquaintance
De,Tréville,knows,him,and,esteems,him,very,highly,and,De,Tréville,as,you,know,is,one,of,the,queens,greatest,friends
As,a,soldier,the,man,ranks,well,he,did,his,whole,duty,and,even,more,at,the,siege,of,Rochelleas,at,Suze,and,Perpignan,But,you,know,Guitant,we,poor,ministers,often,want,men,with,other,qualities,besides,courage,we,want,men,of,talent
Pray,was,not,Monsieur,dArtagnan,in,the,time,of,the,cardinal,mixed,up,in,some,intrigue,from,which,he,came,out,according,to,report,quite,cleverly,My,lord,as,to,the,report,you,allude,toGuitant,perceived,that,the,cardinal,wished,to,make,him,speak,outI,know,nothing,but,what,the,public,knows
I,never,meddle,in,intrigues,and,if,I,occasionally,become,a,confidant,of,the,intrigues,of,others,I,am,sure,your,eminence,will,approve,of,my,keeping,them,secret,Mazarin,shook,his,head
Ah,he,said,some,ministers,are,fortunate,and,find,out,all,that,they,wish,to,know,My,lord,replied,Guitant,such,ministers,do,not,weigh,men,in,the,same,balance,they,get,their,information,on,war,from,warriors,on,intrigues,from,intriguers
Consult,some,politician,of,the,period,of,which,you,speak,and,if,you,pay,well,for,it,you,will,certainly,get,to,know,all,you,want,Eh,pardieu,said,Mazarin,with,a,grimace,which,he,always,made,when,spoken,to,about,money
They,will,be,paid,if,there,is,no,way,of,getting,out,of,it,Does,my,lord,seriously,wish,me,to,name,any,one,who,was,mixed,up,in,the,cabals,of,that,day,By,Bacchus,rejoined,Mazarin,impatiently,its,about,an,hour,since,I,asked,you,for,that,very,thing,woodenhead,that,you,are,There,is,one,man,for,whom,I,can,answer,if,he,will,speak,out,Thats,my,concern,I,will,make,him,speak,Ah,my,lord,tis,not,easy,to,make,people,say,what,they,dont,wish,to,let,out,Pooh
Who,is,he,The,Comte,de,Rochefort,The,Comte,de,Rochefort,Unfortunately,he,has,disappeared,these,four,or,five,years,and,I,dont,know,where,he,is,I,know,Guitant,said,Mazarin
Well,then,how,is,it,that,your,eminence,complained,just,now,of,want,of,information,You,think,resumed,Mazarin,that,Rochefort,He,was,Cardinal,Richelieus,creature,my,lord
I,warn,you,however,his,services,will,cost,you,something
The,cardinal,was,lavish,to,his,underlings,Yes,yes,Guitant,said,Mazarin,Richelieu,was,a,great,man,a,very,great,man,but,he,had,that,defect
Thanks,Guitant,I,shall,benefit,by,your,advice,this,very,evening,Here,they,separated,and,bidding,adieu,to,Guitant,in,the,court,of,the,Palais,Royal,Mazarin,approached,an,officer,who,was,walking,up,and,down,within,that,inclosure
It,was,DArtagnan,who,was,waiting,for,him
Come,hither,said,Mazarin,in,his,softest,voice,I,have,an,order,to,give,you,DArtagnan,bent,low,and,following,the,cardinal,up,the,secret,staircase,soon,found,himself,in,the,study,whence,they,had,first,set,out
The,cardinal,seated,himself,before,his,bureau,and,taking,a,sheet,of,paper,wrote,some,lines,upon,it,whilst,DArtagnan,stood,imperturbable,without,showing,either,impatience,or,curiosity
He,was,like,a,soldierly,automaton,or,rather,like,a,magnificent,marionette
The,cardinal,folded,and,sealed,his,letter
Monsieur,dArtagnan,he,said,you,are,to,take,this,dispatch,to,the,Bastile,and,bring,back,here,the,person,it,concerns
You,must,take,a,carriage,and,an,escort,and,guard,the,prisoner,with,the,greatest,care,DArtagnan,took,the,letter,touched,his,hat,with,his,hand,turned,round,upon,his,heel,like,a,drillsergeant,and,a,moment,afterward,was,heard,in,his,dry,and,monotonous,tone,commanding,Four,men,and,an,escort,a,carriage,and,a,horse,Five,minutes,afterward,the,wheels,of,the,carriage,and,the,horses,shoes,were,heard,resounding,on,the,pavement,of,the,courtyard
DArtagnan,arrived,at,the,Bastile,just,as,it,was,striking,halfpast,eight
His,visit,was,announced,to,the,governor,who,on,hearing,that,he,came,from,the,cardinal,went,to,meet,him,and,received,him,at,the,top,of,the,great,flight,of,steps,outside,the,door
The,governor,of,the,Bastile,was,Monsieur,du,Tremblay,the,brother,of,the,famous,Capuchin,Joseph,that,fearful,favorite,of,Richelieus,who,went,by,the,name,of,the,Gray,Cardinal
During,the,period,that,the,Duc,de,Bassompierre,passed,in,the,Bastilewhere,he,remained,for,twelve,long,yearswhen,his,companions,in,their,dreams,of,liberty,said,to,each,other,As,for,me,I,shall,go,out,of,the,prison,at,such,a,time,and,another,at,such,and,such,a,time,the,duke,used,to,answer,As,for,me,gentlemen,I,shall,leave,only,when,Monsieur,du,Tremblay,leaves,meaning,that,at,the,death,of,the,cardinal,Du,Tremblay,would,certainly,lose,his,place,at,the,Bastile,and,De,Bassompierre,regain,his,at,court
His,prediction,was,nearly,fulfilled,but,in,a,very,different,way,from,that,which,De,Bassompierre,supposed,for,after,the,death,of,Richelieu,everything,went,on,contrary,to,expectation,in,the,same,way,as,before,and,Bassompierre,had,little,chance,of,leaving,his,prison
Monsieur,du,Tremblay,received,DArtagnan,with,extreme,politeness,and,invited,him,to,sit,down,with,him,to,supper,of,which,he,was,himself,about,to,partake
I,should,be,delighted,to,do,so,was,the,reply,but,if,I,am,not,mistaken,the,words,In,haste,are,written,on,the,envelope,of,the,letter,which,I,brought,You,are,right,said,Du,Tremblay
tell,them,to,order,Number,25,to,come,downstairs,The,unhappy,wretch,who,entered,the,Bastile,ceased,as,he,crossed,the,threshold,to,be,a,manhe,became,a,number
DArtagnan,shuddered,at,the,noise,of,the,keys,he,remained,on,horseback,feeling,no,inclination,to,dismount,and,sat,looking,at,the,bars,at,the,buttressed,windows,and,the,immense,walls,he,had,hitherto,only,seen,from,the,other,side,of,the,moat,but,by,which,he,had,for,twenty,years,been,awestruck
I,must,leave,you,said,Du,Tremblay,I,am,sent,for,to,sign,the,release,of,a,prisoner
I,shall,be,happy,to,meet,you,again,sir,May,the,devil,annihilate,me,if,I,return,thy,wish,murmured,DArtagnan,smiling,as,he,pronounced,the,imprecation,I,declare,I,feel,quite,ill,after,only,being,five,minutes,in,the,courtyard
I,would,rather,die,on,straw,than,hoard,up,a,thousand,a,year,by,being,governor,of,the,Bastile,He,had,scarcely,finished,this,soliloquy,before,the,prisoner,arrived
On,seeing,him,DArtagnan,could,hardly,suppress,an,exclamation,of,surprise
The,prisoner,got,into,the,carriage,without,seeming,to,recognize,the,musketeer
Gentlemen,thus,DArtagnan,addressed,the,four,musketeers,I,am,ordered,to,exercise,the,greatest,possible,care,in,guarding,the,prisoner,and,since,there,are,no,locks,to,the,carriage,I,shall,sit,beside,him
Monsieur,de,Lillebonne,lead,my,horse,by,the,bridle,if,you,please,As,he,spoke,he,dismounted,gave,the,bridle,of,his,horse,to,the,musketeer,and,placing,himself,by,the,side,of,the,prisoner,said,in,a,voice,perfectly,composed,To,the,Palais,Royal,at,full,trot,The,carriage,drove,on,and,DArtagnan,availing,himself,of,the,darkness,in,the,archway,under,which,they,were,passing,threw,himself,into,the,arms,of,the,prisoner
I,am,not,mistaken,DArtagnan,cried,Rochefort
my,poor,friend,resumed,DArtagnan,not,having,seen,you,for,four,or,five,years,I,concluded,you,were,dead,Ifaith,said,Rochefort,theres,no,great,difference,I,think,between,a,dead,man,and,one,who,has,been,buried,alive,now,I,have,been,buried,alive,or,very,nearly,so,And,for,what,crime,are,you,imprisoned,in,the,Bastile,Do,you,wish,me,to,speak,the,truth,Yes,Well,then,I,dont,know,Have,you,any,suspicion,of,me,Rochefort,No
on,the,honor,of,a,gentleman,but,I,cannot,be,imprisoned,for,the,reason,alleged,it,is,impossible,What,reason,asked,DArtagnan
you,are,laughing,at,me,I,understand
You,mean,that,this,demands,explanation,do,you,not,I,admit,it,Well,this,is,what,actually,took,place,One,evening,after,an,orgy,in,Reinards,apartment,at,the,Tuileries,with,the,Duc,dHarcourt,Fontrailles,De,Rieux,and,others,the,Duc,dHarcourt,proposed,that,we,should,go,and,pull,cloaks,on,the,Pont,Neuf,that,is,you,know,a,diversion,which,the,Duc,dOrleans,made,quite,the,fashion,Were,you,crazy,Rochefort
at,your,age,No,I,was,drunk
And,yet,since,the,amusement,seemed,to,me,rather,tame,I,proposed,to,Chevalier,de,Rieux,that,we,should,be,spectators,instead,of,actors,and,in,order,to,see,to,advantage,that,we,should,mount,the,bronze,horse
Thanks,to,the,spurs,which,served,as,stirrups,in,a,moment,we,were,perched,upon,the,croupe,we,were,well,placed,and,saw,everything
Four,or,five,cloaks,had,already,been,lifted,with,a,dexterity,without,parallel,and,not,one,of,the,victims,had,dared,to,say,a,word,when,some,fool,of,a,fellow,less,patient,than,the,others,took,it,into,his,head,to,cry,out,Guard,and,drew,upon,us,a,patrol,of,archers
Duc,dHarcourt,Fontrailles,and,the,others,escaped,De,Rieux,was,inclined,to,do,likewise,but,I,told,him,they,wouldnt,look,for,us,where,we,were
He,wouldnt,listen,put,his,foot,on,the,spur,to,get,down,the,spur,broke,he,fell,with,a,broken,leg,and,instead,of,keeping,quiet,took,to,crying,out,like,a,gallowsbird
I,then,was,ready,to,dismount,but,it,was,too,late,I,descended,into,the,arms,of,the,archers
They,conducted,me,to,the,Chatelet,where,I,slept,soundly,being,very,sure,that,on,the,next,day,I,should,go,forth,free
The,next,day,came,and,passed,the,day,after,a,week,I,then,wrote,to,the,cardinal
The,same,day,they,came,for,me,and,took,me,to,the,Bastile
Do,you,believe,it,was,because,I,committed,the,sacrilege,of,mounting,en,croupe,behind,Henry,IV
No,you,are,right,my,dear,Rochefort,it,couldnt,be,for,that,but,you,will,probably,learn,the,reason,soon,Ah,indeed
I,forgot,to,ask,youwhere,are,you,taking,me,To,the,cardinal,What,does,he,want,with,me,I,do,not,know
I,did,not,even,know,that,you,were,the,person,I,was,sent,to,fetch,Impossibleyoua,favorite,of,the,minister,A,favorite
I,am,just,as,poor,a,Gascon,as,when,I,saw,you,at,Meung,twentytwo,years,ago,you,know,alas,and,he,concluded,his,speech,with,a,deep,sigh
Nevertheless,you,come,as,one,in,authority,Because,I,happened,to,be,in,the,antechamber,when,the,cardinal,called,me,by,the,merest,chance
I,am,still,a,lieutenant,in,the,musketeers,and,have,been,so,these,twenty,years,Then,no,misfortune,has,happened,to,you,And,what,misfortune,could,happen,to,me
To,quote,some,Latin,verses,I,have,forgotten,or,rather,never,knew,well,the,thunderbolt,never,falls,on,the,valleys,and,I,am,a,valley,dear,Rochefortone,of,the,lowliest,of,the,low,Then,Mazarin,is,still,Mazarin,The,same,as,ever,my,friend,it,is,said,that,he,is,married,to,the,queen,Married,If,not,her,husband,he,is,unquestionably,her,lover,You,surprise,me

Do,you,hear,the,guns,pray

Since,Mazarin,has,sent,for,you,it,is,because,he,wants,you
Many,a,long,year,has,passed,since,any,one,has,wanted,to,employ,me,so,you,see,in,what,a,situation,I,am,Make,your,complaints,known,thats,my,advice,Listen,Rochefort,let,us,make,a,compact

What,has,become,of,him,I,shouldnt,wonder,if,he,were,at,the,head,of,the,mob,at,this,very,moment
He,married,a,woman,who,keeps,a,confectioners,shop,in,the,Rue,des,Lombards,for,hes,a,lad,who,was,always,fond,of,sweetmeats,hes,now,a,citizen,of,Paris
Youll,see,that,that,queer,fellow,will,be,a,sheriff,before,I,shall,be,a,captain,Come,dear,DArtagnan,look,up,a,little
It,is,when,one,is,lowest,on,the,wheel,of,fortune,that,the,merrygoround,wheels,and,rewards,us
This,evening,your,destiny,begins,to,change,Amen,exclaimed,DArtagnan,stopping,the,carriage
What,are,you,doing,asked,Rochefort
We,are,almost,there,and,I,want,no,one,to,see,me,getting,out,of,your,carriage,we,are,supposed,not,to,know,each,other,You,are,right
Remember,your,promise,In,five,minutes,the,party,entered,the,courtyard,and,DArtagnan,led,the,prisoner,up,the,great,staircase,and,across,the,corridor,and,antechamber
As,they,stopped,at,the,door,of,the,cardinals,study,DArtagnan,was,about,to,be,announced,when,Rochefort,slapped,him,on,his,shoulder
DArtagnan,let,me,confess,to,you,what,Ive,been,thinking,about,during,the,whole,of,my,drive,as,I,looked,out,upon,the,parties,of,citizens,who,perpetually,crossed,our,path,and,looked,at,you,and,your,four,men,with,fiery,eyes,Speak,out,answered,DArtagnan
I,had,only,to,cry,out,Help,for,you,and,for,your,companions,to,be,cut,to,pieces,and,then,I,should,have,been,free,Why,didnt,you,do,it,asked,the,lieutenant
had,any,one,but,you,been,there,I,dont,say,DArtagnan,bowed
Is,it,possible,that,Rochefort,has,become,a,better,man,than,I,am,he,said,to,himself
And,he,caused,himself,to,be,announced,to,the,minister
Let,M,de,Rochefort,enter,said,Mazarin,eagerly,on,hearing,their,names,pronounced,and,beg,M,dArtagnan,to,wait,I,shall,have,further,need,of,him,These,words,gave,great,joy,to,DArtagnan
As,he,had,said,it,had,been,a,long,time,since,any,one,had,needed,him,and,that,demand,for,his,services,on,the,part,of,Mazarin,seemed,to,him,an,auspicious,sign
Rochefort,rendered,suspicious,and,cautious,by,these,words,entered,the,apartment,where,he,found,Mazarin,sitting,at,the,table,dressed,in,his,ordinary,garb,and,as,one,of,the,prelates,of,the,Church,his,costume,being,similar,to,that,of,the,abbés,in,that,day,excepting,that,his,scarf,and,stockings,were,violet
As,the,door,was,closed,Rochefort,cast,a,glance,toward,Mazarin,which,was,answered,by,one,equally,furtive,from,the,minister
There,was,little,change,in,the,cardinal,still,dressed,with,sedulous,care,his,hair,well,arranged,and,curled,his,person,perfumed,he,looked,owing,to,his,extreme,taste,in,dress,only,half,his,age
But,Rochefort,who,had,passed,five,years,in,prison,had,become,old,in,the,lapse,of,a,few,years,the,dark,locks,of,this,estimable,friend,of,the,defunct,Cardinal,Richelieu,were,now,white,the,deep,bronze,of,his,complexion,had,been,succeeded,by,a,mortal,pallor,which,betokened,debility
As,he,gazed,at,him,Mazarin,shook,his,head,slightly,as,much,as,to,say,This,is,a,man,who,does,not,appear,to,me,fit,for,much,After,a,pause,which,appeared,an,age,to,Rochefort,Mazarin,took,from,a,bundle,of,papers,a,letter,and,showing,it,to,the,count,he,said,I,find,here,a,letter,in,which,you,sue,for,liberty,Monsieur,de,Rochefort
You,are,in,prison,then,Rochefort,trembled,in,every,limb,at,this,question
But,I,thought,he,said,that,your,eminence,knew,that,circumstance,better,than,any,one,I
There,is,a,congestion,of,prisoners,in,the,Bastile,who,were,cooped,up,in,the,time,of,Monsieur,de,Richelieu,I,dont,even,know,their,names,Yes,but,in,regard,to,myself,my,lord,it,cannot,be,so,for,I,was,removed,from,the,Chatelet,to,the,Bastile,owing,to,an,order,from,your,eminence,You,think,you,were,I,am,certain,of,it,Ah,stay
Did,you,not,once,refuse,to,undertake,a,journey,to,Brussels,for,the,queen,Ah
Idiot,that,I,am,though,I,have,been,trying,to,find,it,out,for,five,years,I,never,found,it,out,But,I,do,not,say,it,was,the,cause,of,your,imprisonment
I,merely,ask,you,did,you,not,refuse,to,go,to,Brussels,for,the,queen,whilst,you,had,consented,to,go,there,to,do,some,service,for,the,late,cardinal,That,is,the,very,reason,I,refused,to,go,back,to,Brussels
I,was,there,at,a,fearful,moment
I,was,sent,there,to,intercept,a,correspondence,between,Chalais,and,the,archduke,and,even,then,when,I,was,discovered,I,was,nearly,torn,to,pieces
How,could,I,then,return,to,Brussels
I,should,injure,the,queen,instead,of,serving,her,Well,since,the,best,motives,are,liable,to,misconstruction,the,queen,saw,in,your,refusal,nothing,but,a,refusala,distinct,refusal,she,had,also,much,to,complain,of,you,during,the,lifetime,of,the,late,cardinal,yes,her,majesty,the,queen,Rochefort,smiled,contemptuously
Since,I,was,a,faithful,servant,my,lord,to,Cardinal,Richelieu,during,his,life,it,stands,to,reason,that,now,after,his,death,I,should,serve,you,well,in,defiance,of,the,whole,world,With,regard,to,myself,Monsieur,de,Rochefort,replied,Mazarin,I,am,not,like,Monsieur,de,Richelieu,allpowerful
I,am,but,a,minister,who,wants,no,servants,being,myself,nothing,but,a,servant,of,the,queens
Now,the,queen,is,of,a,sensitive,nature
Hearing,of,your,refusal,to,obey,her,she,looked,upon,it,as,a,declaration,of,war,and,as,she,considers,you,a,man,of,superior,talent,and,consequently,dangerous,she,desired,me,to,make,sure,of,you,that,is,the,reason,of,your,being,shut,up,in,the,Bastile
But,your,release,can,be,managed
You,are,one,of,those,men,who,can,comprehend,certain,matters,and,having,understood,them,can,act,with,energy,Such,was,Cardinal,Richelieus,opinion,my,lord,The,cardinal,interrupted,Mazarin,was,a,great,politician,and,therein,shone,his,vast,superiority,over,me
I,am,a,straightforward,simple,man,thats,my,great,disadvantage
I,am,of,a,frankness,of,character,quite,French,Rochefort,bit,his,lips,in,order,to,prevent,a,smile
I,want,friends,I,want,faithful,servants
When,I,say,I,want,I,mean,the,queen,wants,them
I,do,nothing,without,her,commandspray,understand,that,not,like,Monsieur,de,Richelieu,who,went,on,just,as,he,pleased
So,I,shall,never,be,a,great,man,as,he,was,but,to,compensate,for,that,I,shall,be,a,good,man,Monsieur,de,Rochefort,and,I,hope,to,prove,it,to,you,Rochefort,knew,well,the,tones,of,that,soft,voice,in,which,sounded,sometimes,a,sort,of,gentle,lisp,like,the,hissing,of,young,vipers
I,am,disposed,to,believe,your,eminence,he,replied,though,I,have,had,but,little,evidence,of,that,goodnature,of,which,your,eminence,speaks
Do,not,forget,that,I,have,been,five,years,in,the,Bastile,and,that,no,medium,of,viewing,things,is,so,deceptive,as,the,grating,of,a,prison,Ah,Monsieur,de,Rochefort
have,I,not,told,you,already,that,I,had,nothing,to,do,with,that
The,queencannot,you,make,allowances,for,the,pettishness,of,a,queen,and,a,princess
But,that,has,passed,away,as,suddenly,as,it,came,and,is,forgotten,I,can,easily,suppose,sir,that,her,majesty,has,forgotten,it,amid,the,fetes,and,the,courtiers,of,the,Palais,Royal,but,I,who,have,passed,those,years,in,the,Bastile,Ah
do,you,absolutely,think,that,the,Palais,Royal,is,the,abode,of,gayety
We,have,had,great,annoyances,there
As,for,me,I,play,my,game,squarely,fairly,and,above,board,as,I,always,do
Let,us,come,to,some,conclusion
Are,you,one,of,us,Monsieur,de,Rochefort,I,am,very,desirous,of,being,so,my,lord,but,I,am,totally,in,the,dark,about,everything
In,the,Bastile,one,talks,politics,only,with,soldiers,and,jailers,and,you,have,not,an,idea,my,lord,how,little,is,known,of,what,is,going,on,by,people,of,that,sort,I,am,of,Monsieur,de,Bassompierres,party
Is,he,still,one,of,the,seventeen,peers,of,France,He,is,dead,sir,a,great,loss
His,devotion,to,the,queen,was,boundless,men,of,loyalty,are,scarce,I,think,so,forsooth,said,Rochefort,and,when,you,find,any,of,them,you,march,them,off,to,the,Bastile
However,there,are,plenty,in,the,world,but,you,dont,look,in,the,right,direction,for,them,my,lord,Indeed
my,dear,Monsieur,de,Rochefort,how,much,you,must,have,learned,during,your,intimacy,with,the,late,cardinal
he,was,a,great,man,Will,your,eminence,be,angry,if,I,read,you,a,lesson,I
you,know,you,may,say,anything,to,me
I,try,to,be,beloved,not,feared,Well,there,is,on,the,wall,of,my,cell,scratched,with,a,nail,a,proverb,which,says,Like,master,like,servant,Pray,what,does,that,mean,It,means,that,Monsieur,de,Richelieu,was,able,to,find,trusty,servants,dozens,and,dozens,of,them,He
the,point,aimed,at,by,every,poniard
Richelieu,who,passed,his,life,in,warding,off,blows,which,were,forever,aimed,at,him,But,he,did,ward,them,off,said,De,Rochefort,and,the,reason,was,that,though,he,had,bitter,enemies,he,possessed,also,true,friends
I,have,known,persons,he,continuedfor,he,thought,he,might,avail,himself,of,the,opportunity,of,speaking,of,DArtagnanwho,by,their,sagacity,and,address,have,deceived,the,penetration,of,Cardinal,Richelieu,who,by,their,valor,have,got,the,better,of,his,guards,and,spies,persons,without,money,without,support,without,credit,yet,who,have,preserved,to,the,crowned,head,its,crown,and,made,the,cardinal,crave,pardon,But,those,men,you,speak,of,said,Mazarin,smiling,inwardly,on,seeing,Rochefort,approach,the,point,to,which,he,was,leading,him,those,men,were,not,devoted,to,the,cardinal,for,they,contended,against,him,No,in,that,case,they,would,have,met,with,more,fitting,reward
They,had,the,misfortune,to,be,devoted,to,that,very,queen,for,whom,just,now,you,were,seeking,servants,But,how,is,it,that,you,know,so,much,of,these,matters,I,know,them,because,the,men,of,whom,I,speak,were,at,that,time,my,enemies,because,they,fought,against,me,because,I,did,them,all,the,harm,I,could,and,they,returned,it,to,the,best,of,their,ability,because,one,of,them,with,whom,I,had,most,to,do,gave,me,a,pretty,swordthrust,now,about,seven,years,ago,the,third,that,I,received,from,the,same,hand,it,closed,an,old,account,Ah,said,Mazarin,with,admirable,suavity,could,I,but,find,such,men,My,lord,there,has,stood,for,six,years,at,your,very,door,a,man,such,as,I,describe,and,during,those,six,years,he,has,been,unappreciated,and,unemployed,by,you,Who,is,it,It,is,Monsieur,dArtagnan,That,Gascon,cried,Mazarin,with,well,acted,surprise
That,Gascon,has,saved,a,queen,and,made,Monsieur,de,Richelieu,confess,that,in,point,of,talent,address,and,political,skill,to,him,he,was,only,a,tyro,Really,It,is,as,I,have,the,honor,of,telling,it,to,your,excellency,Tell,me,a,little,about,it,my,dear,Monsieur,de,Rochefort,That,is,somewhat,difficult,my,lord,said,Rochefort,with,a,smile
Then,he,will,tell,it,me,himself,I,doubt,it,my,lord,Why,do,you,doubt,it,Because,the,secret,does,not,belong,to,him,because,as,I,have,told,you,it,has,to,do,with,a,great,queen,And,he,was,alone,in,achieving,an,enterprise,like,that,No,my,lord,he,had,three,colleagues,three,brave,men,men,such,as,you,were,wishing,for,just,now,And,were,these,four,men,attached,to,each,other,true,in,heart,really,united,As,if,they,had,been,one,manas,if,their,four,hearts,had,pulsated,in,one,breast,You,pique,my,curiosity,dear,Rochefort,pray,tell,me,the,whole,story,That,is,impossible,but,I,will,tell,you,a,true,story,my,lord,Pray,do,so,I,delight,in,stories,cried,the,cardinal
Listen,then,returned,Rochefort,as,he,spoke,endeavoring,to,read,in,that,subtle,countenance,the,cardinals,motive
Once,upon,a,time,there,lived,a,queena,powerful,monarchwho,reigned,over,one,of,the,greatest,kingdoms,of,the,universe,and,a,minister,and,this,minister,wished,much,to,injure,the,queen,whom,once,he,had,loved,too,well
Do,not,try,my,lord,you,cannot,guess,who,it,is,all,this,happened,long,before,you,came,into,the,country,where,this,queen,reigned
There,came,to,the,court,an,ambassador,so,brave,so,magnificent,so,elegant,that,every,woman,lost,her,heart,to,him,and,the,queen,had,even,the,indiscretion,to,give,him,certain,ornaments,so,rare,that,they,could,never,be,replaced,by,any,like,them
As,these,ornaments,were,given,by,the,king,the,minister,persuaded,his,majesty,to,insist,upon,the,queens,appearing,in,them,as,part,of,her,jewels,at,a,ball,which,was,soon,to,take,place
There,is,no,occasion,to,tell,you,my,lord,that,the,minister,knew,for,a,fact,that,these,ornaments,had,sailed,away,with,the,ambassador,who,was,far,away,beyond,seas
This,illustrious,queen,had,fallen,low,as,the,least,of,her,subjectsfallen,from,her,high,estate,Indeed,Well,my,lord,four,men,resolved,to,save,her
These,four,men,were,not,princes,neither,were,they,dukes,neither,were,they,men,in,power,they,were,not,even,rich
They,were,four,honest,soldiers,each,with,a,good,heart,a,good,arm,and,a,sword,at,the,service,of,those,who,wanted,it
The,minister,knew,of,their,departure,and,had,planted,people,on,the,road,to,prevent,them,ever,reaching,their,destination
Three,of,them,were,overwhelmed,and,disabled,by,numerous,assailants,one,of,them,alone,arrived,at,the,port,having,either,killed,or,wounded,those,who,wished,to,stop,him
He,crossed,the,sea,and,brought,back,the,set,of,ornaments,to,the,great,queen,who,was,able,to,wear,them,on,her,shoulder,on,the,appointed,day,and,this,very,nearly,ruined,the,minister

Well,I,know,of,ten,such,men,Mazarin,made,no,reply,he,reflected

Well,what,is,the,matter,The,matter,is,that,you,have,proposed,to,me,what,is,impossible,said,Rochefort,shaking,his,head,with,an,air,of,disappointment
And,why,is,it,impossible,Because,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,is,one,of,my,friends,or,rather,I,am,one,of,his

He,was,then,reconducted,by,the,little,staircase,instead,of,passing,through,the,antechamber,where,DArtagnan,was,waiting
In,the,courtyard,the,carriage,and,the,four,musketeers,were,ready,but,he,looked,around,in,vain,for,his,friend
Ah,he,muttered,to,himself,this,changes,the,situation,and,if,there,is,still,a,crowd,of,people,in,the,streets,we,will,try,to,show,Mazarin,that,we,are,still,thank,God,good,for,something,else,than,keeping,guard,over,a,prisoner,and,he,jumped,into,the,carriage,with,the,alacrity,of,a,man,of,fiveandtwenty
Anne,of,Austria,at,the,Age,of,Fortysix
When,left,alone,with,Bernouin,Mazarin,was,for,some,minutes,lost,in,thought
He,had,gained,much,information,but,not,enough
Mazarin,was,a,cheat,at,the,cardtable
This,is,a,detail,preserved,to,us,by,Brienne
He,called,it,using,his,advantages
He,now,determined,not,to,begin,the,game,with,DArtagnan,till,he,knew,completely,all,his,adversarys,cards
My,lord,have,you,any,commands,asked,Bernouin
Light,me,I,am,going,to,the,queen,Bernouin,took,up,a,candlestick,and,led,the,way
There,was,a,secret,communication,between,the,cardinals,apartments,and,those,of,the,queen,and,through,this,corridor,Mazarin,passed,whenever,he,wished,to,visit,Anne,of,Austria
This,secret,passage,is,still,to,be,seen,in,the,Palais,Royal
In,the,bedroom,in,which,this,passage,ended,Bernouin,encountered,Madame,de,Beauvais,like,himself,intrusted,with,the,secret,of,these,subterranean,love,affairs,and,Madame,de,Beauvais,undertook,to,prepare,Anne,of,Austria,who,was,in,her,oratory,with,the,young,king,Louis,XIV,to,receive,the,cardinal
Anne,reclining,in,a,large,easychair,her,head,supported,by,her,hand,her,elbow,resting,on,a,table,was,looking,at,her,son,who,was,turning,over,the,leaves,of,a,large,book,filled,with,pictures
This,celebrated,woman,fully,understood,the,art,of,being,dull,with,dignity
It,was,her,practice,to,pass,hours,either,in,her,oratory,or,in,her,room,without,either,reading,or,praying
When,Madame,de,Beauvais,appeared,at,the,door,and,announced,the,cardinal,the,child,who,had,been,absorbed,in,the,pages,of,Quintus,Curtius,enlivened,as,they,were,by,engravings,of,Alexanders,feats,of,arms,frowned,and,looked,at,his,mother
Why,he,said,does,he,enter,without,first,asking,for,an,audience,Anne,colored,slightly
The,prime,minister,she,said,is,obliged,in,these,unsettled,days,to,inform,the,queen,of,all,that,is,happening,from,time,to,time,without,exciting,the,curiosity,or,remarks,of,the,court,But,Richelieu,never,came,in,this,manner,said,the,pertinacious,boy
How,can,you,remember,what,Monsieur,de,Richelieu,did
You,were,too,young,to,know,about,such,things,I,do,not,remember,what,he,did,but,I,have,inquired,and,I,have,been,told,all,about,it,And,who,told,you,about,it,asked,Anne,of,Austria,with,a,movement,of,impatience
I,know,that,I,ought,never,to,name,the,persons,who,answer,my,questions,answered,the,child,for,if,I,do,I,shall,learn,nothing,further,At,this,very,moment,Mazarin,entered
The,king,rose,immediately,took,his,book,closed,it,and,went,to,lay,it,down,on,the,table,near,which,he,continued,standing,in,order,that,Mazarin,might,be,obliged,to,stand,also
Mazarin,contemplated,these,proceedings,with,a,thoughtful,glance
They,explained,what,had,occurred,that,evening
He,bowed,respectfully,to,the,king,who,gave,him,a,somewhat,cavalier,reception,but,a,look,from,his,mother,reproved,him,for,the,hatred,which,from,his,infancy,Louis,XIV
had,entertained,toward,Mazarin,and,he,endeavored,to,receive,the,ministers,homage,with,civility
Anne,of,Austria,sought,to,read,in,Mazarins,face,the,occasion,of,this,unexpected,visit,since,the,cardinal,usually,came,to,her,apartment,only,after,every,one,had,retired
The,minister,made,a,slight,sign,with,his,head,whereupon,the,queen,said,to,Madame,Beauvais,It,is,time,for,the,king,to,go,to,bed,call,Laporte,The,queen,had,several,times,already,told,her,son,that,he,ought,to,go,to,bed,and,several,times,Louis,had,coaxingly,insisted,on,staying,where,he,was,but,now,he,made,no,reply,but,turned,pale,and,bit,his,lips,with,anger
In,a,few,minutes,Laporte,came,into,the,room
The,child,went,directly,to,him,without,kissing,his,mother
Well,Louis,said,Anne,why,do,you,not,kiss,me,I,thought,you,were,angry,with,me,madame,you,sent,me,away,I,do,not,send,you,away,but,you,have,had,the,smallpox,and,I,am,afraid,that,sitting,up,late,may,tire,you,You,had,no,fears,of,my,being,tired,when,you,ordered,me,to,go,to,the,palace,today,to,pass,the,odious,decrees,which,have,raised,the,people,to,rebellion,Sire,interposed,Laporte,in,order,to,turn,the,subject,to,whom,does,your,majesty,wish,me,to,give,the,candle,To,any,one,Laporte,the,child,said,and,then,added,in,a,loud,voice,to,any,one,except,Mancini,Now,Mancini,was,a,nephew,of,Mazarins,and,was,as,much,hated,by,Louis,as,the,cardinal,himself,although,placed,near,his,person,by,the,minister
And,the,king,went,out,of,the,room,without,either,embracing,his,mother,or,even,bowing,to,the,cardinal
Good,said,Mazarin,I,am,glad,to,see,that,his,majesty,has,been,brought,up,with,a,hatred,of,dissimulation,Why,do,you,say,that,asked,the,queen,almost,timidly
Why,it,seems,to,me,that,the,way,in,which,he,left,us,needs,no,explanation
Besides,his,majesty,takes,no,pains,to,conceal,how,little,affection,he,has,for,me
That,however,does,not,hinder,me,from,being,entirely,devoted,to,his,service,as,I,am,to,that,of,your,majesty,I,ask,your,pardon,for,him,cardinal,said,the,queen,he,is,a,child,not,yet,able,to,understand,his,obligations,to,you,The,cardinal,smiled
But,continued,the,queen,you,have,doubtless,come,for,some,important,purpose
What,is,it,then,Mazarin,sank,into,a,chair,with,the,deepest,melancholy,painted,on,his,countenance
It,is,likely,he,replied,that,we,shall,soon,be,obliged,to,separate,unless,you,love,me,well,enough,to,follow,me,to,Italy,Why,cried,the,queen,how,is,that,Because,as,they,say,in,the,opera,of,Thisbe,The,whole,world,conspires,to,break,our,bonds,You,jest,sir,answered,the,queen,endeavoring,to,assume,something,of,her,former,dignity
I,do,not,madame,rejoined,Mazarin
The,whole,world,conspires,to,break,our,bonds
Now,as,you,are,one,of,the,whole,world,I,mean,to,say,that,you,also,are,deserting,me,Cardinal,Heavens

The,blade,was,red,for,the,blood,had,become,rust,after,a,momentary,examination,during,which,the,queen,became,as,white,as,the,cloth,which,covered,the,altar,on,which,she,was,leaning,he,put,it,back,into,the,coffer,with,an,involuntary,shudder

When,he,was,alone,he,opened,the,door,of,the,corridor,and,then,that,of,the,antechamber
There,DArtagnan,was,asleep,upon,a,bench
The,cardinal,went,up,to,him,and,touched,his,shoulder
DArtagnan,started,awakened,himself,and,as,he,awoke,stood,up,exactly,like,a,soldier,under,arms

Monsieur,dArtagnan,said,the,cardinal,sitting,down,on,a,fauteuil,you,have,always,seemed,to,me,to,be,a,brave,and,honorable,man,Possibly,thought,DArtagnan,but,he,has,taken,a,long,time,to,let,me,know,his,thoughts,nevertheless,he,bowed,to,the,very,ground,in,gratitude,for,Mazarins,compliment
Well,continued,Mazarin,the,time,has,come,to,put,to,use,your,talents,and,your,valor,There,was,a,sudden,gleam,of,joy,in,the,officers,eyes,which,vanished,immediately,for,he,knew,nothing,of,Mazarins,purpose

Let,me,be,on,my,guard,And,he,assumed,a,look,of,stupidity,which,Mendori,or,Bellerose,two,of,the,first,actors,of,the,day,might,have,envied
Bravo,cried,Mazarin,they,told,me,that,you,were,the,man,I,wanted
Come,let,us,see,what,you,will,do,for,me,Everything,that,your,eminence,may,please,to,command,me,was,the,reply
You,will,do,for,me,what,you,have,done,for,the,queen,Certainly,DArtagnan,said,to,himself,he,wishes,to,make,me,speak,out
Hes,not,more,cunning,than,De,Richelieu,was
Devil,take,him,Then,he,said,aloud,The,queen,my,lord

Speak,now,the,queen,herself,releases,you,from,your,promise,The,queen,said,DArtagnan,with,an,astonishment,which,this,time,was,not,pretended
And,as,a,proof,of,what,I,say,she,commanded,me,to,show,you,this,diamond,which,she,thinks,you,know,And,so,saying,Mazarin,extended,his,hand,to,the,officer,who,sighed,as,he,recognized,the,ring,so,gracefully,given,to,him,by,the,queen,on,the,night,of,the,ball,at,the,Hotel,de,Ville,and,which,she,had,repurchased,from,Monsieur,des,Essarts
I,remember,well,that,diamond,which,belonged,to,the,queen,You,see,then,that,I,speak,to,you,in,the,queens,name
Answer,me,without,acting,as,if,you,were,on,the,stage,your,interests,are,concerned,in,your,so,doing,Faith,my,lord,it,is,very,necessary,for,me,to,make,my,fortune,your,eminence,has,so,long,forgotten,me,We,need,only,a,week,to,amend,all,that

Yes,if,my,friends,agree,But,if,they,refuse,can,I,count,on,you,I,have,never,accomplished,anything,alone,said,DArtagnan,shaking,his,head
Go,then,and,find,them,What,shall,I,say,to,them,by,way,of,inducement,to,serve,your,eminence,You,know,them,better,than,I
Adapt,your,promises,to,their,respective,characters,What,shall,I,promise,That,if,they,serve,me,as,well,as,they,served,the,queen,my,gratitude,shall,be,magnificent,But,what,are,we,to,do,Make,your,mind,easy,when,the,time,for,action,comes,you,shall,be,put,in,full,possession,of,what,I,require,from,you,wait,till,that,time,arrives,and,find,out,your,friends,My,lord,perhaps,they,are,not,in,Paris
It,is,even,probable,that,I,shall,have,to,make,a,journey
I,am,only,a,lieutenant,of,musketeers,very,poor,and,journeys,cost,money
My,intention,said,Mazarin,is,not,that,you,go,with,a,great,following,my,plans,require,secrecy,and,would,be,jeopardized,by,a,too,extravagant,equipment,Still,my,lord,I,cant,travel,on,my,pay,for,it,is,now,three,months,behind,and,I,cant,travel,on,my,savings,for,in,my,twentytwo,years,of,service,I,have,accumulated,nothing,but,debts,Mazarin,remained,some,moments,in,deep,thought,as,if,he,were,fighting,with,himself,then,going,to,a,large,cupboard,closed,with,a,triple,lock,he,took,from,it,a,bag,of,silver,and,weighing,it,twice,in,his,hands,before,he,gave,it,to,DArtagnan,Take,this,he,said,with,a,sigh,tis,merely,for,your,journey,If,these,are,Spanish,doubloons,or,even,gold,crowns,thought,DArtagnan,we,shall,yet,be,able,to,do,business,together,He,saluted,the,cardinal,and,plunged,the,bag,into,the,depths,of,an,immense,pocket
Well,then,all,is,settled,you,are,to,set,off,said,the,cardinal
Yes,my,lord,Apropos,what,are,the,names,of,your,friends,The,Count,de,la,Fere,formerly,styled,Athos,Monsieur,du,Vallon,whom,we,used,to,call,Porthos,the,Chevalier,dHerblay,now,the,Abbé,dHerblay,whom,we,styled,Aramis,The,cardinal,smiled
Younger,sons,he,said,who,enlisted,in,the,musketeers,under,feigned,names,in,order,not,to,lower,their,family,names
Was,that,it,If,God,willing,these,swords,should,be,devoted,to,the,service,of,your,eminence,said,DArtagnan,I,shall,venture,to,express,a,wish,which,is,that,in,its,turn,the,purse,of,your,eminence,may,become,light,and,theirs,heavyfor,with,these,three,men,your,eminence,may,rouse,all,Europe,if,you,like,These,Gascons,said,the,cardinal,laughing,almost,beat,the,Italians,in,effrontery,At,all,events,answered,DArtagnan,with,a,smile,almost,as,crafty,as,the,cardinals,they,beat,them,when,they,draw,their,swords,He,then,withdrew,and,as,he,passed,into,the,courtyard,he,stopped,near,a,lamp,and,dived,eagerly,into,the,bag,of,money
thou,hast,no,confidence,in,me
so,much,the,worse,for,thee,for,harm,may,come,of,it,Meanwhile,the,cardinal,was,rubbing,his,hands,in,great,satisfaction
for,a,hundred,pistoles,I,have,discovered,a,secret,for,which,Richelieu,would,have,paid,twenty,thousand,crowns,without,reckoning,the,value,of,that,diamondhe,cast,a,complacent,look,at,the,ring,which,he,had,kept,instead,of,restoring,to,DArtagnanwhich,is,worth,at,least,ten,thousand,francs,He,returned,to,his,room,and,after,depositing,the,ring,in,a,casket,filled,with,brilliants,of,every,sort,for,the,cardinal,was,a,connoisseur,in,precious,stones,he,called,to,Bernouin,to,undress,him,regardless,of,the,noises,of,gunfire,that,though,it,was,now,near,midnight,continued,to,resound,through,Paris
In,the,meantime,DArtagnan,took,his,way,toward,the,Rue,Tiquetonne,where,he,lived,at,the,Hotel,de,la,Chevrette
We,will,explain,in,a,few,words,how,DArtagnan,had,been,led,to,choose,that,place,of,residence
Years,have,elapsed,many,events,have,happened,alas
since,in,our,romance,of,The,Three,Musketeers,we,took,leave,of,DArtagnan,at,No
DArtagnan,had,not,failed,in,his,career,but,circumstances,had,been,adverse,to,him
So,long,as,he,was,surrounded,by,his,friends,he,retained,his,youth,and,the,poetry,of,his,character
He,was,one,of,those,fine,ingenuous,natures,which,assimilate,themselves,easily,to,the,dispositions,of,others
Athos,imparted,to,him,his,greatness,of,soul,Porthos,his,enthusiasm,Aramis,his,elegance
Had,DArtagnan,continued,his,intimacy,with,these,three,men,he,would,have,become,a,superior,character
Athos,was,the,first,to,leave,him,in,order,that,he,might,retire,to,a,little,property,he,had,inherited,near,Blois,Porthos,the,second,to,marry,an,attorneys,wife,and,lastly,Aramis,the,third,to,take,orders,and,become,an,abbé
From,that,day,DArtagnan,felt,lonely,and,powerless,without,courage,to,pursue,a,career,in,which,he,could,only,distinguish,himself,on,condition,that,each,of,his,three,companions,should,endow,him,with,one,of,the,gifts,each,had,received,from,Heaven
Notwithstanding,his,commission,in,the,musketeers,DArtagnan,felt,completely,solitary
For,a,time,the,delightful,remembrance,of,Madame,Bonancieux,left,on,his,character,a,certain,poetic,tinge,perishable,indeed,for,like,all,other,recollections,in,this,world,these,impressions,were,by,degrees,effaced
A,garrison,life,is,fatal,even,to,the,most,aristocratic,organization,and,imperceptibly,DArtagnan,always,in,the,camp,always,on,horseback,always,in,garrison,became,I,know,not,how,in,the,present,age,one,would,express,it,a,typical,trooper
His,early,refinement,of,character,was,not,only,not,lost,it,grew,even,greater,than,ever,but,it,was,now,applied,to,the,little,instead,of,to,the,great,things,of,lifeto,the,martial,condition,of,the,soldiercomprised,under,the,head,of,a,good,lodging,a,rich,table,a,congenial,hostess
These,important,advantages,DArtagnan,found,to,his,own,taste,in,the,Rue,Tiquetonne,at,the,sign,of,the,Roe
From,the,time,DArtagnan,took,quarters,in,that,hotel,the,mistress,of,the,house,a,pretty,and,fresh,looking,Flemish,woman,twentyfive,or,twentysix,years,old,had,been,singularly,interested,in,him,and,after,certain,love,passages,much,obstructed,by,an,inconvenient,husband,to,whom,a,dozen,times,DArtagnan,had,made,a,pretence,of,passing,a,sword,through,his,body,that,husband,had,disappeared,one,fine,morning,after,furtively,selling,certain,choice,lots,of,wine,carrying,away,with,him,money,and,jewels
He,was,thought,to,be,dead,his,wife,especially,who,cherished,the,pleasing,idea,that,she,was,a,widow,stoutly,maintained,that,death,had,taken,him
Therefore,after,the,connection,had,continued,three,years,carefully,fostered,by,DArtagnan,who,found,his,bed,and,his,mistress,more,agreeable,every,year,each,doing,credit,to,the,other,the,mistress,conceived,the,extraordinary,desire,of,becoming,a,wife,and,proposed,to,DArtagnan,that,he,should,marry,her
Come,now,you,dont,really,wish,it,But,he,is,dead,I,am,sure,of,it,He,was,a,very,contrary,fellow,and,might,come,back,on,purpose,to,have,us,hanged,All,right,if,he,comes,back,you,will,kill,him,you,are,so,skillful,and,so,brave,Peste
another,way,of,getting,hanged,So,you,refuse,my,request,To,be,sure,I,dofuriously,The,pretty,landlady,was,desolate
She,would,have,taken,DArtagnan,not,only,as,her,husband,but,as,her,God,he,was,so,handsome,and,had,so,fierce,a,mustache
Then,along,toward,the,fourth,year,came,the,expedition,of,FrancheComte
DArtagnan,was,assigned,to,it,and,made,his,preparations,to,depart
There,were,then,great,griefs,tears,without,end,and,solemn,promises,to,remain,faithfulall,of,course,on,the,part,of,the,hostess
DArtagnan,was,too,grand,to,promise,anything,he,purposed,only,to,do,all,that,he,could,to,increase,the,glory,of,his,name
As,to,that,we,know,DArtagnans,courage,he,exposed,himself,freely,to,danger,and,while,charging,at,the,head,of,his,company,he,received,a,ball,through,the,chest,which,laid,him,prostrate,on,the,field,of,battle
He,had,been,seen,falling,from,his,horse,and,had,not,been,seen,to,rise,every,one,therefore,believed,him,to,be,dead,especially,those,to,whom,his,death,would,give,promotion
One,believes,readily,what,he,wishes,to,believe
Now,in,the,army,from,the,divisiongenerals,who,desire,the,death,of,the,generalinchief,to,the,soldiers,who,desire,the,death,of,the,corporals,all,desire,some,ones,death
But,DArtagnan,was,not,a,man,to,let,himself,be,killed,like,that
After,he,had,remained,through,the,heat,of,the,day,unconscious,on,the,battlefield,the,cool,freshness,of,the,night,brought,him,to,himself
He,gained,a,village,knocked,at,the,door,of,the,finest,house,and,was,received,as,the,wounded,are,always,and,everywhere,received,in,France
He,was,petted,tended,cured,and,one,fine,morning,in,better,health,than,ever,before,he,set,out,for,France
Once,in,France,he,turned,his,course,toward,Paris,and,reaching,Paris,went,straight,to,Rue,Tiquetonne
But,DArtagnan,found,in,his,chamber,the,personal,equipment,of,a,man,complete,except,for,the,sword,arranged,along,the,wall
So,much,the,worse,and,so,much,the,better,It,need,not,be,said,that,DArtagnan,was,still,thinking,of,the,husband
He,made,inquiries,and,discovered,that,the,servants,were,new,and,that,the,mistress,had,gone,for,a,walk
With,monsieur,Monsieur,has,returned,then,Of,course,naively,replied,the,servant
If,I,had,any,money,said,DArtagnan,to,himself,I,would,go,away,but,I,have,none
I,must,stay,and,follow,the,advice,of,my,hostess,while,thwarting,the,conjugal,designs,of,this,inopportune,apparition,He,had,just,completed,this,monologuewhich,proves,that,in,momentous,circumstances,nothing,is,more,natural,than,the,monologuewhen,the,servantmaid,watching,at,the,door,suddenly,cried,out,Ah
here,is,madame,returning,with,monsieur,DArtagnan,looked,out,and,at,the,corner,of,Rue,Montmartre,saw,the,hostess,coming,along,hanging,to,the,arm,of,an,enormous,Swiss,who,tiptoed,in,his,walk,with,a,magnificent,air,which,pleasantly,reminded,him,of,his,old,friend,Porthos
Is,that,monsieur,said,DArtagnan,to,himself
he,has,grown,a,good,deal,it,seems,to,me,And,he,sat,down,in,the,hall,choosing,a,conspicuous,place
The,hostess,as,she,entered,saw,DArtagnan,and,uttered,a,little,cry,whereupon,DArtagnan,judging,that,he,had,been,recognized,rose,ran,to,her,and,embraced,her,tenderly
The,Swiss,with,an,air,of,stupefaction,looked,at,the,hostess,who,turned,pale
What,do,you,want,of,me,she,asked,in,great,distress
Is,monsieur,your,brother,said,DArtagnan,not,in,the,slightest,degree,embarrassed,in,the,role,he,was,playing
And,without,waiting,for,her,reply,he,threw,himself,into,the,arms,of,the,Helvetian,who,received,him,with,great,coldness
Who,is,that,man,he,asked
The,hostess,replied,only,by,gasps
Who,is,that,Swiss,asked,DArtagnan
Monsieur,is,going,to,marry,me,replied,the,hostess,between,two,gasps
Your,husband,then,is,at,last,dead,How,does,that,concern,you,replied,the,Swiss
It,concerns,me,much,said,DArtagnan,since,you,cannot,marry,madame,without,my,consent,and,since,And,since,asked,the,Swiss
And,sinceI,do,not,give,it,said,the,musketeer
The,Swiss,became,as,purple,as,a,peony
He,wore,his,elegant,uniform,DArtagnan,was,wrapped,in,a,sort,of,gray,cloak,the,Swiss,was,six,feet,high,DArtagnan,was,hardly,more,than,five,the,Swiss,considered,himself,on,his,own,ground,and,regarded,DArtagnan,as,an,intruder
Will,you,go,away,from,here,demanded,the,Swiss,stamping,violently,like,a,man,who,begins,to,be,seriously,angry
Some,one,must,go,for,help,said,a,lad,who,could,not,comprehend,that,this,little,man,should,make,a,stand,against,that,other,man,who,was,so,large
DArtagnan,with,a,sudden,accession,of,wrath,seized,the,lad,by,the,ear,and,led,him,apart,with,the,injunction,Stay,you,where,you,are,and,dont,you,stir,or,I,will,pull,this,ear,off
As,for,you,illustrious,descendant,of,William,Tell,you,will,straightway,get,together,your,clothes,which,are,in,my,room,and,which,annoy,me,and,go,out,quickly,to,another,lodging,The,Swiss,began,to,laugh,boisterously
And,why,Ah,very,well,said,DArtagnan,I,see,that,you,understand,French
Come,then,and,take,a,turn,with,me,and,I,will,explain,The,hostess,who,knew,DArtagnans,skill,with,the,sword,began,to,weep,and,tear,her,hair
DArtagnan,turned,toward,her,saying,Then,send,him,away,madame,Pooh,said,the,Swiss,who,had,needed,a,little,time,to,take,in,DArtagnans,proposal,pooh
who,are,you,in,the,first,place,to,ask,me,to,take,a,turn,with,you,I,am,lieutenant,in,his,majestys,musketeers,said,DArtagnan,and,consequently,your,superior,in,everything,only,as,the,question,now,is,not,of,rank,but,of,quartersyou,know,the,customcome,and,seek,for,yours,the,first,to,return,will,recover,his,chamber,DArtagnan,led,away,the,Swiss,in,spite,of,lamentations,on,the,part,of,the,hostess,who,in,reality,found,her,heart,inclining,toward,her,former,lover,though,she,would,not,have,been,sorry,to,give,a,lesson,to,that,haughty,musketeer,who,had,affronted,her,by,the,refusal,of,her,hand
It,was,night,when,the,two,adversaries,reached,the,field,of,battle
DArtagnan,politely,begged,the,Swiss,to,yield,to,him,the,disputed,chamber,the,Swiss,refused,by,shaking,his,head,and,drew,his,sword
Then,you,will,lie,here,said,DArtagnan
It,is,a,wretched,bed,but,that,is,not,my,fault,and,it,is,you,who,have,chosen,it,With,these,words,he,drew,in,his,turn,and,crossed,swords,with,his,adversary
He,had,to,contend,against,a,strong,wrist,but,his,agility,was,superior,to,all,force
The,Swiss,received,two,wounds,and,was,not,aware,of,it,by,reason,of,the,cold,but,suddenly,feebleness,occasioned,by,loss,of,blood,obliged,him,to,sit,down
There,said,DArtagnan,what,did,I,tell,you
Fortunately,you,wont,be,laid,up,more,than,a,fortnight
Remain,here,and,I,will,send,you,your,clothes,by,the,boy
Oh,by,the,way,youd,better,take,lodging,in,the,Rue,Montorgueil,at,the,Chat,Qui,Pelote
You,will,be,well,fed,there,if,the,hostess,remains,the,same
Adieu,Thereupon,he,returned,in,a,lively,mood,to,his,room,and,sent,to,the,Swiss,the,things,that,belonged,to,him
The,boy,found,him,sitting,where,DArtagnan,had,left,him,still,overwhelmed,by,the,coolness,of,his,adversary
The,boy,the,hostess,and,all,the,house,had,the,same,regard,for,DArtagnan,that,one,would,have,for,Hercules,should,he,return,to,earth,to,repeat,his,twelve,labors
But,when,he,was,alone,with,the,hostess,he,said,Now,pretty,Madeleine,you,know,the,difference,between,a,Swiss,and,a,gentleman
As,for,you,you,have,acted,like,a,barmaid
So,much,the,worse,for,you,for,by,such,conduct,you,have,lost,my,esteem,and,my,patronage
I,have,driven,away,the,Swiss,to,humiliate,you,but,I,shall,lodge,here,no,longer
I,will,not,sleep,where,I,must,scorn
Have,my,valise,carried,to,the,Muid,dAmour,Rue,des,Bourdonnais
Adieu,madame,In,saying,these,words,DArtagnan,appeared,at,the,same,time,majestic,and,grieved
The,hostess,threw,herself,at,his,feet,asked,his,pardon,and,held,him,back,with,a,sweet,violence
The,spit,turned,the,stove,roared,the,pretty,Madeleine,wept,DArtagnan,felt,himself,invaded,by,hunger,cold,and,love
He,pardoned,and,having,pardoned,he,remained
And,this,explains,how,DArtagnan,had,quarters,in,the,Rue,Tiquetonne,at,the,Hotel,de,la,Chevrette
DArtagnan,then,returned,home,in,thoughtful,mood,finding,a,somewhat,lively,pleasure,in,carrying,Mazarins,bag,of,money,and,thinking,of,that,fine,diamond,which,he,had,once,called,his,own,and,which,he,had,seen,on,the,ministers,finger,that,night
Should,that,diamond,ever,fall,into,my,hands,again,he,reflected,I,would,turn,it,at,once,into,money,I,would,buy,with,the,proceeds,certain,lands,around,my,fathers,chateau,which,is,a,pretty,place,well,enough,but,with,no,land,to,it,at,all,except,a,garden,about,the,size,of,the,Cemetery,des,Innocents,and,I,should,wait,in,all,my,glory,till,some,rich,heiress,attracted,by,my,good,looks,rode,along,to,marry,me
Then,I,should,like,to,have,three,sons,I,should,make,the,first,a,nobleman,like,Athos,the,second,a,good,soldier,like,Porthos,the,third,an,excellent,abbé,like,Aramis
that,would,be,a,far,better,life,than,I,lead,now,but,Monsieur,Mazarin,is,a,mean,wretch,who,wont,dispossess,himself,of,his,diamond,in,my,favor,On,entering,the,Rue,Tiquetonne,he,heard,a,tremendous,noise,and,found,a,dense,crowd,near,the,house
Oho,said,he,is,the,hotel,on,fire,On,approaching,the,hotel,of,the,Roe,he,found,however,that,it,was,in,front,of,the,next,house,the,mob,was,collected
The,people,were,shouting,and,running,about,with,torches
By,the,light,of,one,of,these,torches,DArtagnan,perceived,men,in,uniform
He,asked,what,was,going,on
He,was,told,that,twenty,citizens,headed,by,one,man,had,attacked,a,carriage,which,was,escorted,by,a,troop,of,the,cardinals,bodyguard,but,a,reinforcement,having,come,up,the,assailants,had,been,put,to,flight,and,the,leader,had,taken,refuge,in,the,hotel,next,to,his,lodgings,the,house,was,now,being,searched
In,his,youth,DArtagnan,had,often,headed,the,bourgeoisie,against,the,military,but,he,was,cured,of,all,those,hotheaded,propensities,besides,he,had,the,cardinals,hundred,pistoles,in,his,pocket,so,he,went,into,the,hotel,without,a,word
There,he,found,Madeleine,alarmed,for,his,safety,and,anxious,to,tell,him,all,the,events,of,the,evening,but,he,cut,her,short,by,ordering,her,to,put,his,supper,in,his,room,and,give,him,with,it,a,bottle,of,good,Burgundy
He,took,his,key,and,candle,and,went,upstairs,to,his,bedroom
He,had,been,contented,for,the,convenience,of,the,house,to,lodge,in,the,fourth,story,and,truth,obliges,us,even,to,confess,that,his,chamber,was,just,above,the,gutter,and,below,the,roof
His,first,care,on,entering,it,was,to,lock,up,in,an,old,bureau,with,a,new,lock,his,bag,of,money,and,then,as,soon,as,supper,was,ready,he,sent,away,the,waiter,who,brought,it,up,and,sat,down,to,table
Not,to,reflect,on,what,had,passed,as,one,might,fancy
No,DArtagnan,considered,that,things,are,never,well,done,when,they,are,not,reserved,to,their,proper,time
He,was,hungry,he,supped,he,went,to,bed
Neither,was,he,one,of,those,who,think,that,the,necessary,silence,of,the,night,brings,counsel,with,it
In,the,night,he,slept,but,in,the,morning,refreshed,and,calm,he,was,inspired,with,his,clearest,views,of,everything
It,was,long,since,he,had,any,reason,for,his,mornings,inspiration,but,he,always,slept,all,night,long
At,daybreak,he,awoke,and,took,a,turn,around,his,room
In,43,he,said,just,before,the,death,of,the,late,cardinal,I,received,a,letter,from,Athos
at,the,siege,of,Besancon,I,was,in,the,trenches
He,told,melet,me,thinkwhat,was,it
That,he,was,living,on,a,small,estatebut,where
I,was,just,reading,the,name,of,the,place,when,the,wind,blew,my,letter,away,I,suppose,to,the,Spaniards,theres,no,use,in,thinking,any,more,about,Athos
Let,me,see,with,regard,to,Porthos,I,received,a,letter,from,him,too
He,invited,me,to,a,hunting,party,on,his,property,in,the,month,of,September,1646
Unluckily,as,I,was,then,in,Bearn,on,account,of,my,fathers,death,the,letter,followed,me,there
I,had,left,Bearn,when,it,arrived,and,I,never,received,it,until,the,month,of,April,1647,and,as,the,invitation,was,for,September,1646,I,couldnt,accept,it
Let,me,look,for,this,letter,it,must,be,with,my,title,deeds,DArtagnan,opened,an,old,casket,which,stood,in,a,corner,of,the,room,and,which,was,full,of,parchments,referring,to,an,estate,during,a,period,of,two,hundred,years,lost,to,his,family
He,uttered,an,exclamation,of,delight,for,the,large,handwriting,of,Porthos,was,discernible,and,underneath,some,lines,traced,by,his,worthy,spouse
DArtagnan,eagerly,searched,for,the,heading,of,this,letter,it,was,dated,from,the,Chateau,du,Vallon
Porthos,had,forgotten,that,any,other,address,was,necessary,in,his,pride,he,fancied,that,every,one,must,know,the,Chateau,du,Vallon
Devil,take,the,vain,fellow,said,DArtagnan
However,I,had,better,find,him,out,first,since,he,cant,want,money
Athos,must,have,become,an,idiot,by,this,time,from,drinking
Aramis,must,have,worn,himself,to,a,shadow,of,his,former,self,by,constant,genuflexion,He,cast,his,eyes,again,on,the,letter
There,was,a,postscript,I,write,by,the,same,courier,to,our,worthy,friend,Aramis,in,his,convent,In,his,convent
There,are,about,two,hundred,in,Paris,and,three,thousand,in,France,and,then,perhaps,on,entering,the,convent,he,changed,his,name
if,I,were,but,learned,in,theology,I,should,recollect,what,it,was,he,used,to,dispute,about,with,the,curate,of,Montdidier,and,the,superior,of,the,Jesuits,when,we,were,at,Crevecoeur,I,should,know,what,doctrine,he,leans,to,and,I,should,glean,from,that,what,saint,he,has,adopted,as,his,patron
Well,suppose,I,go,back,to,the,cardinal,and,ask,him,for,a,passport,into,all,the,convents,one,can,find,even,into,the,nunneries
It,would,be,a,curious,idea,and,maybe,I,should,find,my,friend,under,the,name,of,Achilles
I,should,lose,myself,in,the,cardinals,opinion
Great,people,only,thank,you,for,doing,the,impossible,whats,possible,they,say,they,can,effect,themselves,and,they,are,right
But,let,us,wait,a,little,and,reflect
I,received,a,letter,from,him,the,dear,fellow,in,which,he,even,asked,me,for,some,small,service,which,in,fact,I,rendered,him
Yes,yes,but,now,what,did,I,do,with,that,letter,DArtagnan,thought,a,moment,and,then,went,to,the,wardrobe,in,which,hung,his,old,clothes
He,looked,for,his,doublet,of,the,year,1648,and,as,he,had,orderly,habits,he,found,it,hanging,on,its,nail
He,felt,in,the,pocket,and,drew,from,it,a,paper,it,was,the,letter,of,Aramis,Monsieur,DArtagnan,You,know,that,I,have,had,a,quarrel,with,a,certain,gentleman,who,has,given,me,an,appointment,for,this,evening,in,the,Place,Royale
As,I,am,of,the,church,and,the,affair,might,injure,me,if,I,should,share,it,with,any,other,than,a,sure,friend,like,you,I,write,to,beg,that,you,will,serve,me,as,second
You,will,enter,by,the,Rue,Neuve,Sainte,Catherine,under,the,second,lamp,on,the,right,you,will,find,your,adversary
I,shall,be,with,mine,under,the,third
Wholly,yours,Aramis,DArtagnan,tried,to,recall,his,remembrances
He,had,gone,to,the,rendezvous,had,encountered,there,the,adversary,indicated,whose,name,he,had,never,known,had,given,him,a,pretty,swordstroke,on,the,arm,then,had,gone,toward,Aramis,who,at,the,same,time,came,to,meet,him,having,already,finished,his,affair
It,is,over,Aramis,had,said
I,think,I,have,killed,the,insolent,fellow
But,dear,friend,if,you,ever,need,me,you,know,that,I,am,entirely,devoted,to,you,Thereupon,Aramis,had,given,him,a,clasp,of,the,hand,and,had,disappeared,under,the,arcades
So,then,he,no,more,knew,where,Aramis,was,than,where,Athos,and,Porthos,were,and,the,affair,was,becoming,a,matter,of,great,perplexity,when,he,fancied,he,heard,a,pane,of,glass,break,in,his,room,window
He,thought,directly,of,his,bag,and,rushed,from,the,inner,room,where,he,was,sleeping
He,was,not,mistaken,as,he,entered,his,bedroom,a,man,was,getting,in,by,the,window
you,scoundrel,cried,DArtagnan,taking,the,man,for,a,thief,and,seizing,his,sword
Sir,cried,the,man,in,the,name,of,Heaven,put,your,sword,back,into,the,sheath,and,dont,kill,me,unheard
Im,no,thief,but,an,honest,citizen,well,off,in,the,world,with,a,house,of,my,own
but,surely,you,are,Monsieur,dArtagnan,And,thouPlanchet,cried,the,lieutenant
At,your,service,sir,said,Planchet,overwhelmed,with,joy,if,I,were,still,capable,of,serving,you,Perhaps,so,replied,DArtagnan
But,why,the,devil,dost,thou,run,about,the,tops,of,houses,at,seven,oclock,of,the,morning,in,the,month,of,January,Sir,said,Planchet,you,must,know,but,perhaps,you,ought,not,to,know,Tell,us,what,returned,DArtagnan,but,first,put,a,napkin,against,the,window,and,draw,the,curtains,Sir,said,the,prudent,Planchet,in,the,first,place,are,you,on,good,terms,with,Monsieur,de,Rochefort,Perfectly,one,of,my,dearest,friends,Ah
so,much,the,better,But,what,has,De,Rochefort,to,do,with,this,manner,you,have,of,invading,my,room,Ah,sir
I,must,first,tell,you,that,Monsieur,de,Rochefort,is,Planchet,hesitated
Egad,I,know,where,he,is,said,DArtagnan
Hes,in,the,Bastile,That,is,to,say,he,was,there,replied,Planchet
But,in,returning,thither,last,night,when,fortunately,you,did,not,accompany,him,as,his,carriage,was,crossing,the,Rue,de,la,Ferronnerie,his,guards,insulted,the,people,who,began,to,abuse,them
The,prisoner,thought,this,a,good,opportunity,for,escape,he,called,out,his,name,and,cried,for,help
I,heard,the,name,of,Rochefort
I,said,in,a,loud,voice,that,he,was,a,prisoner,a,friend,of,the,Duc,de,Beaufort,who,called,for,help
The,people,were,infuriated,they,stopped,the,horses,and,cut,the,escort,to,pieces,whilst,I,opened,the,doors,of,the,carriage,and,Monsieur,de,Rochefort,jumped,out,and,soon,was,lost,amongst,the,crowd
At,this,moment,a,patrol,passed,by
I,was,obliged,to,sound,a,retreat,toward,the,Rue,Tiquetonne,I,was,pursued,and,took,refuge,in,the,house,next,to,this,where,I,have,been,concealed,between,two,mattresses
This,morning,I,ventured,to,run,along,the,gutters,and,Well,interrupted,DArtagnan,I,am,delighted,that,De,Rochefort,is,free,but,as,for,thee,if,thou,shouldst,fall,into,the,hands,of,the,kings,servants,they,will,hang,thee,without,mercy
Nevertheless,I,promise,thee,thou,shalt,be,hidden,here,though,I,risk,by,concealing,thee,neither,more,nor,less,than,my,lieutenancy,if,it,was,found,out,that,I,gave,one,rebel,an,asylum,Ah
sir,you,know,well,I,would,risk,my,life,for,you,Thou,mayst,add,that,thou,hast,risked,it,Planchet
I,have,not,forgotten,all,I,owe,thee
Sit,down,there,and,eat,in,security
I,see,thee,cast,expressive,glances,at,the,remains,of,my,supper,Yes,sir,for,all,Ive,had,since,yesterday,was,a,slice,of,bread,and,butter,with,preserves,on,it
Although,I,dont,despise,sweet,things,in,proper,time,and,place,I,found,the,supper,rather,light,Poor,fellow,said,DArtagnan
Well,come,set,to,Ah,sir,you,are,going,to,save,my,life,a,second,time,cried,Planchet
And,he,seated,himself,at,the,table,and,ate,as,he,did,in,the,merry,days,of,the,Rue,des,Fossoyeurs,whilst,DArtagnan,walked,to,and,fro,and,thought,how,he,could,make,use,of,Planchet,under,present,circumstances
While,he,turned,this,over,in,his,mind,Planchet,did,his,best,to,make,up,for,lost,time,at,table
At,last,he,uttered,a,sigh,of,satisfaction,and,paused,as,if,he,had,partially,appeased,his,hunger
Come,said,DArtagnan,who,thought,that,it,was,now,a,convenient,time,to,begin,his,interrogations,dost,thou,know,where,Athos,is,No,sir,replied,Planchet
Dost,know,where,Porthos,is,Nonot,at,all,And,Aramis,Not,in,the,least,The,devil
the,devil,But,sir,said,Planchet,with,a,look,of,shrewdness,I,know,where,Bazin,is,Where,is,he,At,Notre,Dame,What,has,he,to,do,at,Notre,Dame,He,is,beadle,Bazin,beadle,at,Notre,Dame
He,must,know,where,his,master,is,Without,a,doubt,he,must,DArtagnan,thought,for,a,moment,then,took,his,sword,and,put,on,his,cloak,to,go,out
Sir,said,Planchet,in,a,mournful,tone,do,you,abandon,me,thus,to,my,fate
Think,if,I,am,found,out,here,the,people,of,the,house,who,have,not,seen,me,enter,it,will,take,me,for,a,thief,True,said,DArtagnan
Canst,thou,speak,any,patois,I,can,do,something,better,than,that,sir,I,can,speak,Flemish,Where,the,devil,didst,thou,learn,it,In,Artois,where,I,fought,for,years
Goeden,morgen,mynheer,eth,teen,begeeray,le,weeten,the,ge,sond,heets,omstand,Which,means,Goodday,sir
I,am,anxious,to,know,the,state,of,your,health,He,calls,that,a,language
But,never,mind,that,will,do,capitally,DArtagnan,opened,the,door,and,called,out,to,a,waiter,to,desire,Madeleine,to,come,upstairs
When,the,landlady,made,her,appearance,she,expressed,much,astonishment,at,seeing,Planchet
My,dear,landlady,said,DArtagnan,I,beg,to,introduce,to,you,your,brother,who,is,arrived,from,Flanders,and,whom,I,am,going,to,take,into,my,service,My,brother,Wish,your,sister,goodmorning,Master,Peter,Wilkom,suster,said,Planchet
Goeden,day,broder,replied,the,astonished,landlady
This,is,the,case,said,DArtagnan,this,is,your,brother,Madeleine,you,dont,know,him,perhaps,but,I,know,him,he,has,arrived,from,Amsterdam
You,must,dress,him,up,during,my,absence
When,I,return,which,will,be,in,about,an,hour,you,must,offer,him,to,me,as,a,servant,and,upon,your,recommendation,though,he,doesnt,speak,a,word,of,French,I,take,him,into,my,service
You,understand,That,is,to,say,I,guess,your,wishes,and,that,is,all,thats,necessary,said,Madeleine
You,are,a,precious,creature,my,pretty,hostess,and,I,am,much,obliged,to,you,The,next,moment,DArtagnan,was,on,his,way,to,Notre,Dame
Touches,upon,the,Strange,Effects,a,Halfpistole,may,have
DArtagnan,as,he,crossed,the,Pont,Neuf,congratulated,himself,on,having,found,Planchet,again,for,at,that,time,an,intelligent,servant,was,essential,to,him,nor,was,he,sorry,that,through,Planchet,and,the,situation,which,he,held,in,Rue,des,Lombards,a,connection,with,the,bourgeoisie,might,be,commenced,at,that,critical,period,when,that,class,were,preparing,to,make,war,with,the,court,party
It,was,like,having,a,spy,in,the,enemys,camp
In,this,frame,of,mind,grateful,for,the,accidental,meeting,with,Planchet,pleased,with,himself,DArtagnan,reached,Notre,Dame
He,ran,up,the,steps,entered,the,church,and,addressing,a,verger,who,was,sweeping,the,chapel,asked,him,if,he,knew,Monsieur,Bazin
Monsieur,Bazin,the,beadle,said,the,verger
There,he,is,attending,mass,in,the,chapel,of,the,Virgin,DArtagnan,nearly,jumped,for,joy,he,had,despaired,of,finding,Bazin,but,now,he,thought,since,he,held,one,end,of,the,thread,he,would,be,pretty,sure,to,reach,the,other,end
He,knelt,down,just,opposite,the,chapel,in,order,not,to,lose,sight,of,his,man,and,as,he,had,almost,forgotten,his,prayers,and,had,omitted,to,take,a,book,with,him,he,made,use,of,his,time,in,gazing,at,Bazin
Bazin,wore,his,dress,it,may,be,observed,with,equal,dignity,and,saintly,propriety
It,was,not,difficult,to,understand,that,he,had,gained,the,crown,of,his,ambition,and,that,the,silvermounted,wand,he,brandished,was,in,his,eyes,as,honorable,a,distinction,as,the,marshals,baton,which,Condé,threw,or,did,not,throw,into,the,enemys,line,of,battle,at,Fribourg
His,person,had,undergone,a,change,analogous,to,the,change,in,his,dress,his,figure,had,grown,rotund,and,as,it,were,canonical
The,striking,points,of,his,face,were,effaced,he,had,still,a,nose,but,his,cheeks,fattened,out,each,took,a,portion,of,it,unto,themselves,his,chin,had,joined,his,throat,his,eyes,were,swelled,up,with,the,puffiness,of,his,cheeks,his,hair,cut,straight,in,holy,guise,covered,his,forehead,as,far,as,his,eyebrows
The,officiating,priest,was,just,finishing,mass,whilst,DArtagnan,was,looking,at,Bazin,he,pronounced,the,words,of,the,holy,Sacrament,and,retired,giving,the,benediction,which,was,received,by,the,kneeling,communicants,to,the,astonishment,of,DArtagnan,who,recognized,in,the,priest,the,coadjutor,himself,the,famous,Jean,Francois,Gondy,who,at,that,time,having,a,presentiment,of,the,part,he,was,to,play,was,beginning,to,court,popularity,by,almsgiving
It,was,to,this,end,that,he,performed,from,time,to,time,some,of,those,early,masses,which,the,common,people,generally,alone,attended
DArtagnan,knelt,as,well,as,the,rest,received,his,share,of,the,benediction,and,made,the,sign,of,the,cross,but,when,Bazin,passed,in,his,turn,with,his,eyes,raised,to,Heaven,and,walking,in,all,humility,the,very,last,DArtagnan,pulled,him,by,the,hem,of,his,robe
Bazin,looked,down,and,started,as,if,he,had,seen,a,serpent
Monsieur,dArtagnan,he,cried,Vade,retro,Satanas,So,my,dear,Bazin,said,the,officer,laughing,this,is,the,way,you,receive,an,old,friend,Sir,replied,Bazin,the,true,friends,of,a,Christian,are,those,who,aid,him,in,working,out,his,salvation,not,those,who,hinder,him,in,doing,so,I,dont,understand,you,Bazin,nor,can,I,see,how,I,can,be,a,stumblingblock,in,the,way,of,your,salvation,said,DArtagnan
You,forget,sir,that,you,very,nearly,ruined,forever,that,of,my,master,and,that,it,was,owing,to,you,that,he,was,very,nearly,being,damned,eternally,for,remaining,a,musketeer,whilst,all,the,time,his,true,vocation,was,the,church,My,dear,Bazin,you,ought,to,perceive,said,DArtagnan,from,the,place,in,which,you,find,me,that,I,am,greatly,changed,in,everything
Age,produces,good,sense,and,as,I,doubt,not,but,that,your,master,is,on,the,road,to,salvation,I,want,you,to,tell,me,where,he,is,that,he,may,help,me,to,mine,Rather,say,to,take,him,back,with,you,into,the,world
Fortunately,I,dont,know,where,he,is,How,cried,DArtagnan,you,dont,know,where,Aramis,is,Formerly,replied,Bazin,Aramis,was,his,name,of,perdition
By,Aramis,is,meant,Simara,which,is,the,name,of,a,demon
Happily,for,him,he,has,ceased,to,bear,that,name,And,therefore,said,DArtagnan,resolved,to,be,patient,to,the,end,it,is,not,Aramis,I,seek,but,the,Abbé,dHerblay
Come,my,dear,Bazin,tell,me,where,he,is,Didnt,you,hear,me,tell,you,Monsieur,dArtagnan,that,I,dont,know,where,he,is,Yes,certainly,but,to,that,I,answer,that,it,is,impossible,It,is,nevertheless,the,truth,monsieurthe,pure,truth,the,truth,of,the,good,God,DArtagnan,saw,clearly,that,he,would,get,nothing,out,of,this,man,who,was,evidently,telling,a,falsehood,in,his,pretended,ignorance,of,the,abode,of,Aramis,but,whose,lies,were,bold,and,decided
Well,Bazin,said,DArtagnan,since,you,do,not,know,where,your,master,lives,let,us,speak,of,it,no,more,let,us,part,good,friends
Accept,this,halfpistole,to,drink,to,my,health,I,do,not,drinkBazin,pushed,away,with,dignity,the,officers,handtis,good,only,for,the,laity,Incorruptible,murmured,DArtagnan,I,am,unlucky,and,whilst,he,was,lost,in,thought,Bazin,retreated,toward,the,sacristy,and,even,there,he,could,not,think,himself,safe,until,he,had,shut,and,locked,the,door,behind,him
DArtagnan,was,still,in,deep,thought,when,some,one,touched,him,on,the,shoulder
He,turned,and,was,about,to,utter,an,exclamation,of,surprise,when,the,other,made,to,him,a,sign,of,silence
You,here,Rochefort,he,said,in,a,low,voice
Did,you,know,that,I,am,at,liberty,I,knew,it,from,the,fountainheadfrom,Planchet
And,what,brought,you,here,I,came,to,thank,God,for,my,happy,deliverance,said,Rochefort
I,suppose,that,is,not,all,To,take,my,orders,from,the,coadjutor,and,to,see,if,we,cannot,wake,up,Mazarin,a,little,A,bad,plan,youll,be,shut,up,again,in,the,Bastile,Oh,as,to,that,I,shall,take,care,I,assure,you
The,air,the,fresh,free,air,is,so,good,besides,and,Rochefort,drew,a,deep,breath,as,he,spoke,I,am,going,into,the,country,to,make,a,tour,Stop,cried,DArtagnan,I,too,am,going,And,if,I,may,without,impertinence,askwhere,are,you,going,To,seek,my,friends,What,friends,Those,that,you,asked,about,yesterday,Athos,Porthos,and,Aramisyou,are,looking,for,them,Yes,On,honor,What,then,is,there,surprising,in,that,Nothing
And,in,whose,behalf,are,you,looking,for,them,You,are,in,no,doubt,on,that,score,That,is,true,Unfortunately,I,have,no,idea,where,they,are,And,you,have,no,way,to,get,news,of,them
Wait,a,week,and,I,myself,will,give,you,some,A,week,is,too,long
I,must,find,them,within,three,days,Three,days,are,a,short,time,and,France,is,large,No,matter,you,know,the,word,must,with,that,word,great,things,are,done,And,when,do,you,set,out,I,am,now,on,my,road,Good,luck,to,you,And,to,youa,good,journey,Perhaps,we,shall,meet,on,our,road,That,is,not,probable,Who,knows
Apropos,should,Mazarin,speak,to,you,about,me,tell,him,that,I,should,have,requested,you,to,acquaint,him,that,in,a,short,time,he,will,see,whether,I,am,as,he,says,too,old,for,action,And,Rochefort,went,away,with,one,of,those,diabolical,smiles,which,used,formerly,to,make,DArtagnan,shudder,but,DArtagnan,could,now,see,it,without,alarm,and,smiling,in,his,turn,with,an,expression,of,melancholy,which,the,recollections,called,up,by,that,smile,could,perhaps,alone,give,to,his,countenance,he,said,Go,demon,do,what,thou,wilt
It,matters,little,now,to,me
Theres,no,second,Constance,in,the,world,On,his,return,to,the,cathedral,DArtagnan,saw,Bazin,who,was,conversing,with,the,sacristan
Bazin,was,making,with,his,spare,little,short,arms,ridiculous,gestures
DArtagnan,perceived,that,he,was,enforcing,prudence,with,respect,to,himself
DArtagnan,slipped,out,of,the,cathedral,and,placed,himself,in,ambuscade,at,the,corner,of,the,Rue,des,Canettes,it,was,impossible,that,Bazin,should,go,out,of,the,cathedral,without,his,seeing,him
In,five,minutes,Bazin,made,his,appearance,looking,in,every,direction,to,see,if,he,were,observed,but,he,saw,no,one
Calmed,by,appearances,he,ventured,to,walk,on,through,the,Rue,Notre,Dame
Then,DArtagnan,rushed,out,of,his,hiding,place,and,arrived,in,time,to,see,Bazin,turn,down,the,Rue,de,la,Juiverie,and,enter,in,the,Rue,de,la,Calandre,a,respectable,looking,house,and,this,DArtagnan,felt,no,doubt,was,the,habitation,of,the,worthy,beadle
Afraid,of,making,any,inquiries,at,this,house,DArtagnan,entered,a,small,tavern,at,the,corner,of,the,street,and,asked,for,a,cup,of,hypocras
This,beverage,required,a,good,halfhour,to,prepare
And,DArtagnan,had,time,therefore,to,watch,Bazin,unsuspected
He,perceived,in,the,tavern,a,pert,boy,between,twelve,and,fifteen,years,of,age,whom,he,fancied,he,had,seen,not,twenty,minutes,before,under,the,guise,of,a,chorister
He,questioned,him,and,as,the,boy,had,no,interest,in,deceiving,DArtagnan,learned,that,he,exercised,from,six,oclock,in,the,morning,until,nine,the,office,of,chorister,and,from,nine,oclock,till,midnight,that,of,a,waiter,in,the,tavern
Whilst,he,was,talking,to,this,lad,a,horse,was,brought,to,the,door,of,Bazins,house
Look,said,the,boy,theres,our,beadle,who,is,going,a,journey,And,where,is,he,going,asked,DArtagnan
Forsooth,I,dont,know,Half,a,pistole,if,you,can,find,out,said,DArtagnan
For,me,cried,the,boy,his,eyes,sparkling,with,joy,if,I,can,find,out,where,Bazin,is,going
You,are,not,joking,are,you,No,on,the,honor,of,an,officer,there,is,the,halfpistole,and,he,showed,him,the,seductive,coin,but,did,not,give,it,him
I,shall,ask,him,Just,the,very,way,not,to,know
Wait,till,he,is,set,out,and,then,marry,come,up,ask,and,find,out
The,halfpistole,is,ready,and,he,put,it,back,again,into,his,pocket
I,understand,said,the,child,with,that,jeering,smile,which,marks,especially,the,gamin,de,Paris,Well,we,must,wait,They,had,not,long,to,wait
Five,minutes,afterward,Bazin,set,off,on,a,full,trot,urging,on,his,horse,by,the,blows,of,a,parapluie,which,he,was,in,the,habit,of,using,instead,of,a,riding,whip
Scarcely,had,he,turned,the,corner,of,the,Rue,de,la,Juiverie,when,the,boy,rushed,after,him,like,a,bloodhound,on,full,scent
Before,ten,minutes,had,elapsed,the,child,returned
Well,answered,the,boy,the,thing,is,done,Where,is,he,gone,The,halfpistole,is,for,me,Doubtless,answer,me,I,want,to,see,it
Give,it,me,that,I,may,see,it,is,not,false,There,it,is,The,child,put,the,piece,of,money,into,his,pocket
And,now,where,is,he,gone,inquired,DArtagnan
He,is,gone,to,Noisy,How,dost,thou,know,Ah,faith
there,was,no,great,cunning,necessary
I,knew,the,horse,he,rode,it,belonged,to,the,butcher,who,lets,it,out,now,and,then,to,M,Bazin
Now,I,thought,that,the,butcher,would,not,let,his,horse,out,like,that,without,knowing,where,it,was,going
And,he,answered,that,Monsieur,Bazin,went,to,Noisy,Tis,his,custom
He,goes,two,or,three,times,a,week,Dost,thou,know,Noisy,well,I,think,so,truly,my,nurse,lives,there,Is,there,a,convent,at,Noisy,Isnt,there,a,great,and,grand,onethe,convent,of,Jesuits,What,is,thy,name,Friquet,DArtagnan,wrote,the,childs,name,in,his,tablets
Please,sir,said,the,boy,do,you,think,I,can,gain,any,more,halfpistoles,in,any,way,Perhaps,replied,DArtagnan
And,having,got,out,all,he,wanted,he,paid,for,the,hypocras,which,he,did,not,drink,and,went,quickly,back,to,the,Rue,Tiquetonne
DArtagnan,Going,to,a,Distance,to,discover,Aramis
On,entering,the,hotel,DArtagnan,saw,a,man,sitting,in,a,corner,by,the,fire
It,was,Planchet,but,so,completely,transformed,thanks,to,the,old,clothes,that,the,departing,husband,had,left,behind,that,DArtagnan,himself,could,hardly,recognize,him
Madeleine,introduced,him,in,presence,of,all,the,servants
Planchet,addressed,the,officer,with,a,fine,Flemish,phrase,the,officer,replied,in,words,that,belonged,to,no,language,at,all,and,the,bargain,was,concluded,Madeleines,brother,entered,DArtagnans,service
The,plan,adopted,by,DArtagnan,was,soon,perfected
He,resolved,not,to,reach,Noisy,in,the,day,for,fear,of,being,recognized,he,had,therefore,plenty,of,time,before,him,for,Noisy,is,only,three,or,four,leagues,from,Paris,on,the,road,to,Meaux
He,began,his,day,by,breakfasting,substantiallya,bad,beginning,when,one,wants,to,employ,the,head,but,an,excellent,precaution,when,one,wants,to,work,the,body,and,about,two,oclock,he,had,his,two,horses,saddled,and,followed,by,Planchet,he,quitted,Paris,by,the,Barriere,de,la,Villete
A,most,active,search,was,still,prosecuted,in,the,house,near,the,Hotel,de,la,Chevrette,for,the,discovery,of,Planchet
At,about,a,league,and,a,half,from,the,city,DArtagnan,finding,that,in,his,impatience,he,had,set,out,too,soon,stopped,to,give,the,horses,breathing,time
The,inn,was,full,of,disreputable,looking,people,who,seemed,as,if,they,were,on,the,point,of,commencing,some,nightly,expedition
A,man,wrapped,in,a,cloak,appeared,at,the,door,but,seeing,a,stranger,he,beckoned,to,his,companions,and,two,men,who,were,drinking,in,the,inn,went,out,to,speak,to,him
DArtagnan,on,his,side,went,up,to,the,landlady,praised,her,winewhich,was,a,horrible,production,from,the,country,of,Montreuiland,heard,from,her,that,there,were,only,two,houses,of,importance,in,the,village,one,of,these,belonged,to,the,Archbishop,of,Paris,and,was,at,that,time,the,abode,of,his,niece,the,Duchess,of,Longueville,the,other,was,a,convent,of,Jesuits,and,was,the,propertya,by,no,means,unusual,circumstanceof,these,worthy,fathers
At,four,oclock,DArtagnan,recommenced,his,journey
He,proceeded,slowly,and,in,deep,reverie
Planchet,also,was,lost,in,thought,but,the,subject,of,their,reflections,was,not,the,same
One,word,which,their,landlady,had,pronounced,had,given,a,particular,turn,to,DArtagnans,deliberations,this,was,the,name,of,Madame,de,Longueville
That,name,was,indeed,one,to,inspire,imagination,and,produce,thought
Madame,de,Longueville,was,one,of,the,highest,ladies,in,the,realm,she,was,also,one,of,the,greatest,beauties,at,court
She,had,formerly,been,suspected,of,an,intimacy,of,too,tender,a,nature,with,Coligny,who,for,her,sake,had,been,killed,in,a,duel,in,the,Place,Royale,by,the,Duc,de,Guise
She,was,now,connected,by,bonds,of,a,political,nature,with,the,Prince,de,Marsillac,the,eldest,son,of,the,old,Duc,de,Rochefoucauld,whom,she,was,trying,to,inspire,with,an,enmity,toward,the,Duc,de,Condé,her,brotherinlaw,whom,she,now,hated,mortally
DArtagnan,thought,of,all,these,matters
He,remembered,how,at,the,Louvre,he,had,often,seen,as,she,passed,by,him,in,the,full,radiance,of,her,dazzling,charms,the,beautiful,Madame,de,Longueville
He,thought,of,Aramis,who,without,possessing,any,greater,advantages,than,himself,had,formerly,been,the,lover,of,Madame,de,Chevreuse,who,had,been,to,a,former,court,what,Madame,de,Longueville,was,in,that,day,and,he,wondered,how,it,was,that,there,should,be,in,the,world,people,who,succeed,in,every,wish,some,in,ambition,others,in,love,whilst,others,either,from,chance,or,from,illluck,or,from,some,natural,defect,or,impediment,remain,halfway,upon,the,road,toward,fulfilment,of,their,hopes,and,expectations
He,was,confessing,to,himself,that,he,belonged,to,the,latter,unhappy,class,when,Planchet,approached,and,said,I,will,lay,a,wager,your,honor,that,you,and,I,are,thinking,of,the,same,thing,I,doubt,it,Planchet,replied,DArtagnan,but,what,are,you,thinking,of,I,am,thinking,sir,of,those,desperate,looking,men,who,were,drinking,in,the,inn,where,we,rested,Always,cautious,Planchet,Tis,instinct,your,honor,Well,what,does,your,instinct,tell,you,now,Sir,my,instinct,told,me,that,those,people,were,assembled,there,for,some,bad,purpose,and,I,was,reflecting,on,what,my,instinct,had,told,me,in,the,darkest,corner,of,the,stable,when,a,man,wrapped,in,a,cloak,and,followed,by,two,other,men,came,in,Ah,ah,said,DArtagnan,Planchets,recital,agreeing,with,his,own,observations

I,have,seen,his,servant,said,one,and,that,applies,very,well,to,me,Well,He,must,certainly,be,at,Noisy,or,be,coming,there,this,evening,said,the,other,and,that,applies,very,well,to,you,What,else,Then,the,prince,said,Take,notice,that,in,all,probability,he,will,be,disguised,as,a,cavalier,which,seems,to,me,to,leave,no,room,for,doubt,since,you,are,dressed,as,a,cavalier,and,not,as,an,officer,of,musketeers
Now,then,what,do,you,say,to,that,Alas

They,had,traveled,onward,about,half,a,mile,when,Planchet,came,close,up,to,DArtagnan
Stop,sir,look,yonder,he,whispered,dont,you,see,in,the,darkness,something,pass,by,like,shadows

The,obscurity,was,broken,only,now,and,then,by,the,still,darker,lines,of,the,roofs,of,houses
Here,and,there,a,dog,barked,behind,a,door,or,an,affrighted,cat,fled,precipitately,from,the,midst,of,the,pavement,to,take,refuge,behind,a,pile,of,faggots,from,which,retreat,her,eyes,would,shine,like,peridores
These,were,the,only,living,creatures,that,seemed,to,inhabit,the,village
Toward,the,middle,of,the,town,commanding,the,principal,open,space,rose,a,dark,mass,separated,from,the,rest,of,the,world,by,two,lanes,and,overshadowed,in,the,front,by,enormous,limetrees
DArtagnan,looked,attentively,at,the,building
This,he,said,to,Planchet,must,be,the,archbishops,chateau,the,abode,of,the,fair,Madame,de,Longueville,but,the,convent,where,is,that,The,convent,your,honor,is,at,the,other,end,of,the,village,I,know,it,well,Well,then,Planchet,gallop,up,to,it,whilst,I,tighten,my,horses,girth,and,come,back,and,tell,me,if,there,is,a,light,in,any,of,the,Jesuits,windows,In,about,five,minutes,Planchet,returned

We,have,experienced,the,ingratitude,of,the,great,as,you,well,know,Tis,true,replied,DArtagnan
Yet,the,great,sometimes,repent,of,their,ingratitude,In,that,case,it,would,be,quite,another,thing
lets,be,merciful,to,every,sinner
Besides,you,are,right,in,another,respect,which,is,in,thinking,that,if,we,were,to,meddle,in,politics,there,could,not,be,a,better,time,than,the,present,How,can,you,know,that
You,who,never,interest,yourself,in,politics,Ah
without,caring,about,them,myself,I,live,among,those,who,are,much,occupied,in,them
Poet,as,I,am,I,am,intimate,with,Sarazin,who,is,devoted,to,the,Prince,de,Conti,and,with,Monsieur,de,BoisRobert,who,since,the,death,of,Cardinal,Richelieu,is,of,all,parties,or,any,party,so,that,political,discussions,have,not,altogether,been,uninteresting,to,me,I,have,no,doubt,of,it,said,DArtagnan
Now,my,dear,friend,look,upon,all,I,tell,you,as,merely,the,statement,of,a,monkof,a,man,who,resembles,an,echorepeating,simply,what,he,hears
I,understand,that,Mazarin,is,at,this,very,moment,extremely,uneasy,as,to,the,state,of,affairs,that,his,orders,are,not,respected,like,those,of,our,former,bugbear,the,deceased,cardinal,whose,portrait,as,you,see,hangs,yonderfor,whatever,may,be,thought,of,him,it,must,be,allowed,that,Richelieu,was,great,I,will,not,contradict,you,there,said,DArtagnan
My,first,impressions,were,favorable,to,the,minister,I,said,to,myself,that,a,minister,is,never,loved,but,that,with,the,genius,this,one,was,said,to,have,he,would,eventually,triumph,over,his,enemies,and,would,make,himself,feared,which,in,my,opinion,is,much,more,to,be,desired,than,to,be,loved,DArtagnan,made,a,sign,with,his,head,which,indicated,that,he,entirely,approved,that,doubtful,maxim
This,then,continued,Aramis,was,my,first,opinion,but,as,I,am,very,ignorant,in,matters,of,this,kind,and,as,the,humility,which,I,profess,obliges,me,not,to,rest,on,my,own,judgment,but,to,ask,the,opinion,of,others,I,have,inquiredEhmy,friend,Aramis,paused
I,must,confess,that,I,was,mistaken
Monsieur,de,Mazarin,is,not,a,man,of,genius,as,I,thought,he,is,a,man,of,no,originonce,a,servant,of,Cardinal,Bentivoglio,and,he,got,on,by,intrigue
He,is,an,upstart,a,man,of,no,name,who,will,only,be,the,tool,of,a,party,in,France
He,will,amass,wealth,he,will,injure,the,kings,revenue,and,pay,to,himself,the,pensions,which,Richelieu,paid,to,others
He,is,neither,a,gentleman,in,manner,nor,in,feeling,but,a,sort,of,buffoon,a,punchinello,a,pantaloon
I,do,not,Hem,said,DArtagnan,there,is,some,truth,in,what,you,say,Ah
it,fills,me,with,pride,to,find,that,thanks,to,a,common,sort,of,penetration,with,which,I,am,endowed,I,am,approved,by,a,man,like,you,fresh,from,the,court,But,you,speak,of,him,not,of,his,party,his,resources,It,is,truethe,queen,is,for,him,Something,in,his,favor,But,he,will,never,have,the,king,A,mere,child,A,child,who,will,be,of,age,in,four,years
Then,he,has,neither,the,parliament,nor,the,people,with,himthey,represent,the,wealth,of,the,country,nor,the,nobles,nor,the,princes,who,are,the,military,power,of,France,DArtagnan,scratched,his,ear
He,was,forced,to,confess,to,himself,that,this,reasoning,was,not,only,comprehensive,but,just
You,see,my,poor,friend,that,I,am,sometimes,bereft,of,my,ordinary,thoughtfulness,perhaps,I,am,wrong,in,speaking,thus,to,you,who,have,evidently,a,leaning,to,Mazarin,I,cried,DArtagnan,not,in,the,least,You,spoke,of,a,mission,Did,I
I,was,wrong,then,no,I,said,what,you,saythere,is,a,crisis,at,hand
lets,fly,the,feather,before,the,wind,let,us,join,with,that,side,to,which,the,wind,will,carry,it,and,resume,our,adventurous,life
We,were,once,four,valiant,knightsfour,hearts,fondly,united,let,us,unite,again,not,our,hearts,which,have,never,been,severed,but,our,courage,and,our,fortunes
Heres,a,good,opportunity,for,getting,something,better,than,a,diamond,You,are,right,DArtagnan,I,held,a,similar,project,but,as,I,had,not,nor,ever,shall,have,your,fruitful,vigorous,imagination,the,idea,was,suggested,to,me
Every,one,nowadays,wants,auxiliaries,propositions,have,been,made,to,me,and,I,confess,to,you,frankly,that,the,coadjutor,has,made,me,speak,out,Monsieur,de,Gondy
the,cardinals,enemy,No,the,kings,friend,said,Aramis,the,kings,friend,you,understand
Well,it,is,a,question,of,serving,the,king,the,gentlemans,duty,But,the,king,is,with,Mazarin,He,is,but,not,willingly,in,appearance,not,heart,and,that,is,exactly,the,snare,the,kings,enemies,are,preparing,for,the,poor,child,Ah
but,this,is,indeed,civil,war,which,you,propose,to,me,dear,Aramis,War,for,the,king,Yet,the,king,will,be,at,the,head,of,the,army,on,Mazarins,side,But,his,heart,will,be,in,the,army,commanded,by,the,Duc,de,Beaufort,Monsieur,de,Beaufort
He,is,at,Vincennes,Did,I,say,Monsieur,de,Beaufort
Monsieur,de,Beaufort,or,Monsieur,le,Prince,But,Monsieur,le,Prince,is,to,set,out,for,the,army,he,is,entirely,devoted,to,the,cardinal,Oh,oh,said,Aramis,there,are,questions,between,them,at,this,very,moment
And,besides,if,it,is,not,the,prince,then,Monsieur,de,Gondy,But,Monsieur,de,Gondy,is,to,be,made,a,cardinal,they,are,soliciting,the,hat,for,him,And,are,there,no,cardinals,that,can,fight
Come,now,recall,the,four,cardinals,that,at,the,head,of,armies,have,equalled,Monsieur,de,Guebriant,and,Monsieur,de,Gassion,But,a,humpbacked,general
Under,the,cuirass,the,hump,will,not,be,seen
Besides,remember,that,Alexander,was,lame,and,Hannibal,had,but,one,eye,Do,you,see,any,great,advantage,in,adhering,to,this,party,asked,DArtagnan
I,foresee,in,it,the,aid,of,powerful,princes,With,the,enmity,of,the,government,Counteracted,by,parliament,and,insurrections,That,may,be,done,if,they,can,separate,the,king,from,his,mother,That,may,be,done,said,Aramis
You,Aramis,know,Anne,of,Austria,better,than,I,do
Do,you,think,she,will,ever,forget,that,her,son,is,her,safeguard,her,shield,the,pledge,for,her,dignity,for,her,fortune,and,her,life
Should,she,forsake,Mazarin,she,must,join,her,son,and,go,over,to,the,princes,side,but,you,know,better,than,I,do,that,there,are,certain,reasons,why,she,can,never,abandon,Mazarin,Perhaps,you,are,right,said,Aramis,thoughtfully,therefore,I,shall,not,pledge,myself,To,them,or,to,us,do,you,mean,Aramis,To,no,one
I,am,a,priest,resumed,Aramis
What,have,I,to,do,with,politics
I,am,not,obliged,to,read,any,breviary
I,have,a,jolly,little,circle,of,witty,abbés,and,pretty,women,everything,goes,on,smoothly,so,certainly,dear,friend,I,shall,not,meddle,in,politics,Well,listen,my,dear,Aramis,said,DArtagnan,your,philosophy,convinces,me,on,my,honor
I,dont,know,what,devil,of,an,insect,stung,me,and,made,me,ambitious
I,have,a,post,by,which,I,live,at,the,death,of,Monsieur,de,Tréville,who,is,old,I,may,be,a,captain,which,is,a,very,snug,berth,for,a,once,penniless,Gascon
Instead,of,running,after,adventures,I,shall,accept,an,invitation,from,Porthos,I,shall,go,and,shoot,on,his,estate
You,know,he,has,estatesPorthos,I,should,think,so,indeed
Ten,leagues,of,wood,of,marsh,land,and,valleys,he,is,lord,of,the,hill,and,the,plain,and,is,now,carrying,on,a,suit,for,his,feudal,rights,against,the,Bishop,of,Noyon,Good,said,DArtagnan,to,himself
Thats,what,I,wanted,to,know
Porthos,is,in,Picardy,Then,aloud,And,he,has,taken,his,ancient,name,of,Vallon,To,which,he,adds,that,of,Bracieux,an,estate,which,has,been,a,barony,by,my,troth,So,that,Porthos,will,be,a,baron,I,dont,doubt,it
The,Baroness,Porthos,will,sound,particularly,charming,And,the,two,friends,began,to,laugh
So,DArtagnan,resumed,you,will,not,become,a,partisan,of,Mazarins,Nor,you,of,the,Prince,de,Condé,No,let,us,belong,to,no,party,but,remain,friends,let,us,be,neither,Cardinalists,nor,Frondists,Adieu,then,And,DArtagnan,poured,out,a,glass,of,wine
Unhappily,those,times,are,past,Nonsense
At,all,events,if,you,want,me,remember,the,Rue,Tiquetonne,Hotel,de,la,Chevrette,And,I,shall,be,at,the,convent,of,Jesuits,from,six,in,the,morning,to,eight,at,night,come,by,the,door
From,eight,in,the,evening,until,six,in,the,morning,come,in,by,the,window,Adieu,dear,friend,Oh,I,cant,let,you,go,so
I,will,go,with,you,And,he,took,his,sword,and,cloak
He,wants,to,be,sure,that,I,go,away,said,DArtagnan,to,himself
Aramis,whistled,for,Bazin,but,Bazin,was,asleep,in,the,antechamber,and,Aramis,was,obliged,to,shake,him,by,the,ear,to,awake,him
Bazin,stretched,his,arms,rubbed,his,eyes,and,tried,to,go,to,sleep,again
Come,come,sleepy,head,quick,the,ladder,But,said,Bazin,yawning,portentously,the,ladder,is,still,at,the,window,The,other,one,the,gardeners
Didnt,you,see,that,Monsieur,dArtagnan,mounted,with,difficulty
It,will,be,even,more,difficult,to,descend,DArtagnan,was,about,to,assure,Aramis,that,he,could,descend,easily,when,an,idea,came,into,his,head,which,silenced,him
Bazin,uttered,a,profound,sigh,and,went,out,to,look,for,the,ladder
Presently,a,good,solid,wooden,ladder,was,placed,against,the,window
Now,then,said,DArtagnan,this,is,something,like,this,is,a,means,of,communication
A,woman,could,go,up,a,ladder,like,that,Aramiss,searching,look,seemed,to,seek,his,friends,thought,even,at,the,bottom,of,his,heart,but,DArtagnan,sustained,the,inquisition,with,an,air,of,admirable,simplicity
Besides,at,that,moment,he,put,his,foot,on,the,first,step,of,the,ladder,and,began,his,descent
In,a,moment,he,was,on,the,ground
Stay,there,said,Aramis,I,shall,return,immediately,The,two,friends,went,toward,the,shed
At,their,approach,Planchet,came,out,leading,the,two,horses
That,is,good,to,see,said,Aramis
There,is,a,servant,active,and,vigilant,not,like,that,lazy,fellow,Bazin,who,is,no,longer,good,for,anything,since,he,became,connected,with,the,church
Follow,us,Planchet,we,shall,continue,our,conversation,to,the,end,of,the,village,They,traversed,the,width,of,the,village,talking,of,indifferent,things,then,as,they,reached,the,last,houses,Go,then,dear,friend,said,Aramis,follow,your,own,career
Fortune,lavishes,her,smiles,upon,you,do,not,let,her,flee,from,your,embrace
As,for,me,I,remain,in,my,humility,and,indolence
Adieu,Thus,tis,quite,decided,said,DArtagnan,that,what,I,have,to,offer,to,you,does,not,tempt,you,On,the,contrary,it,would,tempt,me,were,I,any,other,man,rejoined,Aramis,but,I,repeat,I,am,made,up,of,contradictions
What,I,hate,today,I,adore,tomorrow,and,vice,versa
You,see,that,I,cannot,like,you,for,instance,settle,on,any,fixed,plan,Thou,liest,subtile,one,said,DArtagnan,to,himself
Thou,alone,on,the,contrary,knowest,how,to,choose,thy,object,and,to,gain,it,stealthily,The,friends,embraced
They,descended,into,the,plain,by,the,ladder
Planchet,met,them,hard,by,the,shed
DArtagnan,jumped,into,the,saddle,then,the,old,companions,in,arms,again,shook,hands
DArtagnan,and,Planchet,spurred,their,steeds,and,took,the,road,to,Paris
But,after,he,had,gone,about,two,hundred,steps,DArtagnan,stopped,short,alighted,threw,the,bridle,of,his,horse,over,the,arm,of,Planchet,and,took,the,pistols,from,his,saddlebow,to,fasten,them,to,his,girdle
This,is,the,matter,be,he,ever,so,cunning,he,shall,never,say,I,was,his,dupe
Stand,here,dont,stir,turn,your,back,to,the,road,and,wait,for,me,Having,thus,spoken,DArtagnan,cleared,the,ditch,by,the,roadside,and,crossed,the,plain,so,as,to,wind,around,the,village
He,had,observed,between,the,house,that,Madame,de,Longueville,inhabited,and,the,convent,of,the,Jesuits,an,open,space,surrounded,by,a,hedge
The,moon,had,now,risen,and,he,could,see,well,enough,to,retrace,his,road
He,reached,the,hedge,and,hid,himself,behind,it,in,passing,by,the,house,where,the,scene,which,we,have,related,took,place,he,remarked,that,the,window,was,again,lighted,up,and,he,was,convinced,that,Aramis,had,not,yet,returned,to,his,own,apartment,and,that,when,he,did,it,would,not,be,alone
In,truth,in,a,few,minutes,he,heard,steps,approaching,and,low,whispers
Close,to,the,hedge,the,steps,stopped
DArtagnan,knelt,down,near,the,thickest,part,of,the,hedge
Two,men,to,the,astonishment,of,DArtagnan,appeared,shortly,soon,however,his,surprise,vanished,for,he,heard,the,murmurs,of,a,soft,harmonious,voice,one,of,these,two,men,was,a,woman,disguised,as,a,cavalier
Calm,yourself,dear,Rene,said,the,soft,voice,the,same,thing,will,never,happen,again
I,have,discovered,a,sort,of,subterranean,passage,which,runs,beneath,the,street,and,we,shall,only,have,to,raise,one,of,the,marble,slabs,before,the,door,to,open,you,an,entrance,and,an,outlet,Oh,answered,another,voice,which,DArtagnan,instantly,recognized,as,that,of,Aramis
I,swear,to,you,princess,that,if,your,reputation,did,not,depend,on,precautions,and,if,my,life,alone,were,jeopardized,Yes,yes
I,know,you,are,as,brave,and,venturesome,as,any,man,in,the,world,but,you,do,not,belong,to,me,alone,you,belong,to,all,our,party
sensible,I,always,obey,madame,when,I,am,commanded,by,so,gentle,a,voice,He,kissed,her,hand,tenderly
Ah,exclaimed,the,cavalier,with,a,soft,voice
Do,you,not,see,that,the,wind,has,blown,off,my,hat,Aramis,rushed,after,the,fugitive,hat
DArtagnan,took,advantage,of,the,circumstance,to,find,a,place,in,the,hedge,not,so,thick,where,his,glance,could,penetrate,to,the,supposed,cavalier
At,that,instant,the,moon,inquisitive,perhaps,like,DArtagnan,came,from,behind,a,cloud,and,by,her,light,DArtagnan,recognized,the,large,blue,eyes,the,golden,hair,and,the,classic,head,of,the,Duchess,de,Longueville
Aramis,returned,laughing,one,hat,on,his,head,and,the,other,in,his,hand,and,he,and,his,companion,resumed,their,walk,toward,the,convent
Good,said,DArtagnan,rising,and,brushing,his,knees,now,I,have,theethou,art,a,Frondeur,and,the,lover,of,Madame,de,Longueville,Monsieur,Porthos,du,Vallon,de,Bracieux,de,Pierrefonds
Thanks,to,what,Aramis,had,told,him,DArtagnan,who,knew,already,that,Porthos,called,himself,Du,Vallon,was,now,aware,that,he,styled,himself,from,his,estate,De,Bracieux,and,that,he,was,on,account,of,this,estate,engaged,in,a,lawsuit,with,the,Bishop,of,Noyon
It,was,then,in,the,neighborhood,of,Noyon,that,he,must,seek,that,estate
His,itinerary,was,promptly,determined,he,would,go,to,Dammartin,from,which,place,two,roads,diverge,one,toward,Soissons,the,other,toward,Compiegne,there,he,would,inquire,concerning,the,Bracieux,estate,and,go,to,the,right,or,to,the,left,according,to,the,information,obtained
Planchet,who,was,still,a,little,concerned,for,his,safety,after,his,recent,escapade,declared,that,he,would,follow,DArtagnan,even,to,the,end,of,the,world,either,by,the,road,to,the,right,or,by,that,to,the,left,only,he,begged,his,former,master,to,set,out,in,the,evening,for,greater,security,to,himself
DArtagnan,suggested,that,he,should,send,word,to,his,wife,so,that,she,might,not,be,anxious,about,him,but,Planchet,replied,with,much,sagacity,that,he,was,very,sure,his,wife,would,not,die,of,anxiety,through,not,knowing,where,he,was,while,he,Planchet,remembering,her,incontinence,of,tongue,would,die,of,anxiety,if,she,did,know
This,reasoning,seemed,to,DArtagnan,so,satisfactory,that,he,no,further,insisted,and,about,eight,oclock,in,the,evening,the,time,when,the,vapors,of,night,begin,to,thicken,in,the,streets,he,left,the,Hotel,de,la,Chevrette,and,followed,by,Planchet,set,forth,from,the,capital,by,way,of,the,Saint,Denis,gate
At,midnight,the,two,travelers,were,at,Dammartin,but,it,was,then,too,late,to,make,inquiriesthe,host,of,the,Cygne,de,la,Croix,had,gone,to,bed
The,next,morning,DArtagnan,summoned,the,host,one,of,those,sly,Normans,who,say,neither,yes,nor,no,and,fear,to,commit,themselves,by,giving,a,direct,answer
DArtagnan,however,gathered,from,his,equivocal,replies,that,the,road,to,the,right,was,the,one,he,ought,to,take,and,on,that,uncertain,information,he,resumed,his,journey
At,nine,in,the,morning,he,reached,Nanteuil,and,stopped,for,breakfast
His,host,here,was,a,good,fellow,from,Picardy,who,gave,him,all,the,information,he,needed
The,Bracieux,estate,was,a,few,leagues,from,VillarsCotterets
DArtagnan,was,acquainted,with,VillarsCotterets,having,gone,thither,with,the,court,on,several,occasions,for,at,that,time,VillarsCotterets,was,a,royal,residence
He,therefore,shaped,his,course,toward,that,place,and,dismounted,at,the,Dauphin,dOr
There,he,ascertained,that,the,Bracieux,estate,was,four,leagues,distant,but,that,Porthos,was,not,at,Bracieux
Porthos,had,in,fact,been,involved,in,a,dispute,with,the,Bishop,of,Noyon,in,regard,to,the,Pierrefonds,property,which,adjoined,his,own,and,weary,at,length,of,a,legal,controversy,which,was,beyond,his,comprehension,he,put,an,end,to,it,by,purchasing,Pierrefonds,and,added,that,name,to,his,others
He,now,called,himself,Du,Vallon,de,Bracieux,de,Pierrefonds,and,resided,on,his,new,estate
The,travelers,were,therefore,obliged,to,stay,at,the,hotel,until,the,next,day,the,horses,had,done,ten,leagues,that,day,and,needed,rest
It,is,true,they,might,have,taken,others,but,there,was,a,great,forest,to,pass,through,and,Planchet,as,we,have,seen,had,no,liking,for,forests,after,dark
There,was,another,thing,that,Planchet,had,no,liking,for,and,that,was,starting,on,a,journey,with,a,hungry,stomach
Accordingly,DArtagnan,on,awaking,found,his,breakfast,waiting,for,him
It,need,not,be,said,that,Planchet,in,resuming,his,former,functions,resumed,also,his,former,humility,and,was,not,ashamed,to,make,his,breakfast,on,what,was,left,by,DArtagnan
It,was,nearly,eight,oclock,when,they,set,out,again
Their,course,was,clearly,defined,they,were,to,follow,the,road,toward,Compiegne,and,on,emerging,from,the,forest,turn,to,the,right
The,morning,was,beautiful,and,in,this,early,springtime,the,birds,sang,on,the,trees,and,the,sunbeams,shone,through,the,misty,glades,like,curtains,of,golden,gauze
In,other,parts,of,the,forest,the,light,could,scarcely,penetrate,through,the,foliage,and,the,stems,of,two,old,oak,trees,the,refuge,of,the,squirrel,startled,by,the,travelers,were,in,deep,shadow
There,came,up,from,all,nature,in,the,dawn,of,day,a,perfume,of,herbs,flowers,and,leaves,which,delighted,the,heart
DArtagnan,sick,of,the,closeness,of,Paris,thought,that,when,a,man,had,three,names,of,his,different,estates,joined,one,to,another,he,ought,to,be,very,happy,in,such,a,paradise,then,he,shook,his,head,saying,If,I,were,Porthos,and,DArtagnan,came,to,make,me,such,a,proposition,as,I,am,going,to,make,to,him,I,know,what,I,should,say,to,it,As,to,Planchet,he,thought,of,little,or,nothing,but,was,happy,as,a,huntinghound,in,his,old,masters,company
At,the,extremity,of,the,wood,DArtagnan,perceived,the,road,that,had,been,described,to,him,and,at,the,end,of,the,road,he,saw,the,towers,of,an,immense,feudal,castle
oh,he,said,I,fancied,this,castle,belonged,to,the,ancient,branch,of,Orleans
Can,Porthos,have,negotiated,for,it,with,the,Duc,de,Longueville,Faith,exclaimed,Planchet,heres,land,in,good,condition,if,it,belongs,to,Monsieur,Porthos,I,wish,him,joy,Zounds,cried,DArtagnan,dont,call,him,Porthos,nor,even,Vallon,call,him,De,Bracieux,or,De,Pierrefonds,thou,wilt,knell,out,damnation,to,my,mission,otherwise,As,he,approached,the,castle,which,had,first,attracted,his,eye,DArtagnan,was,convinced,that,it,could,not,be,there,that,his,friend,dwelt,the,towers,though,solid,and,as,if,built,yesterday,were,open,and,broken
One,might,have,fancied,that,some,giant,had,cleaved,them,with,blows,from,a,hatchet
On,arriving,at,the,extremity,of,the,castle,DArtagnan,found,himself,overlooking,a,beautiful,valley,in,which,at,the,foot,of,a,charming,little,lake,stood,several,scattered,houses,which,humble,in,their,aspect,and,covered,some,with,tiles,others,with,thatch,seemed,to,acknowledge,as,their,sovereign,lord,a,pretty,chateau,built,about,the,beginning,of,the,reign,of,Henry,IV,and,surmounted,by,four,stately,gilded,weathercocks
DArtagnan,no,longer,doubted,that,this,was,Porthoss,pleasant,dwelling,place
The,road,led,straight,up,to,the,chateau,which,compared,to,its,ancestor,on,the,hill,was,exactly,what,a,fop,of,the,coterie,of,the,Duc,dEnghein,would,have,been,beside,a,knight,in,steel,armor,in,the,time,of,Charles,VII
DArtagnan,spurred,his,horse,on,and,pursued,his,road,followed,by,Planchet,at,the,same,pace
In,ten,minutes,DArtagnan,reached,the,end,of,an,alley,regularly,planted,with,fine,poplars,and,terminating,in,an,iron,gate,the,points,and,crossed,bars,of,which,were,gilt
In,the,midst,of,this,avenue,was,a,nobleman,dressed,in,green,and,with,as,much,gilding,about,him,as,the,iron,gate,riding,on,a,tall,horse
On,his,right,hand,and,his,left,were,two,footmen,with,the,seams,of,their,dresses,laced
A,considerable,number,of,clowns,were,assembled,and,rendered,homage,to,their,lord
Ah,said,DArtagnan,to,himself,can,this,be,the,Seigneur,du,Vallon,de,Bracieux,de,Pierrefonds
how,he,has,shrunk,since,he,gave,up,the,name,of,Porthos,This,cannot,be,Monsieur,Porthos,observed,Planchet,replying,as,it,were,to,his,masters,thoughts
Monsieur,Porthos,was,six,feet,high,this,man,is,scarcely,five,Nevertheless,said,DArtagnan,the,people,are,bowing,very,low,to,this,person,As,he,spoke,he,rode,toward,the,tall,horseto,the,man,of,importance,and,his,valets
As,he,approached,he,seemed,to,recognize,the,features,of,this,individual
Jesu,cried,Planchet,can,it,be,At,this,exclamation,the,man,on,horseback,turned,slowly,and,with,a,lofty,air,and,the,two,travelers,could,see,displayed,in,all,their,brilliancy,the,large,eyes,the,vermilion,visage,and,the,eloquent,smile,ofMousqueton
It,was,indeed,MousquetonMousqueton,as,fat,as,a,pig,rolling,about,with,rude,health,puffed,out,with,good,living,who,recognizing,DArtagnan,and,acting,very,differently,from,the,hypocrite,Bazin,slipped,off,his,horse,and,approached,the,officer,with,his,hat,off,so,that,the,homage,of,the,assembled,crowd,was,turned,toward,this,new,sun,which,eclipsed,the,former,luminary
Monsieur,dArtagnan,cried,Mousqueton,his,fat,cheeks,swelling,out,and,his,whole,frame,perspiring,with,joy,Monsieur,dArtagnan
what,joy,for,my,lord,and,master,Du,Vallon,de,Bracieux,de,Pierrefonds,Thou,good,Mousqueton

DArtagnan,was,secretly,touched,with,remorse,not,at,inducing,Porthos,to,enter,into,schemes,in,which,his,life,and,fortune,would,be,in,jeopardy,for,Porthos,in,the,title,of,baron,had,his,object,and,reward,but,poor,Mousqueton,whose,only,wish,was,to,be,called,Moustonwas,it,not,cruel,to,snatch,him,from,the,delightful,state,of,peace,and,plenty,in,which,he,was
He,was,thinking,of,these,matters,when,Porthos,summoned,him,to,dinner
What,time,is,it,then,Eh
why,it,is,after,one,oclock,Your,home,is,a,paradise,Porthos,one,takes,no,note,of,time
I,follow,you,though,I,am,not,hungry,Come,if,one,cant,always,eat,one,can,always,drinka,maxim,of,poor,Athos,the,truth,of,which,I,have,discovered,since,I,began,to,be,lonely,DArtagnan,who,as,a,Gascon,was,inclined,to,sobriety,seemed,not,so,sure,as,his,friend,of,the,truth,of,Athoss,maxim,but,he,did,his,best,to,keep,up,with,his,host
Meanwhile,his,misgivings,in,regard,to,Mousqueton,recurred,to,his,mind,and,with,greater,force,because,Mousqueton,though,he,did,not,himself,wait,on,the,table,which,would,have,been,beneath,him,in,his,new,position,appeared,at,the,door,from,time,to,time,and,evinced,his,gratitude,to,DArtagnan,by,the,quality,of,the,wine,he,directed,to,be,served
Therefore,when,at,dessert,upon,a,sign,from,DArtagnan,Porthos,had,sent,away,his,servants,and,the,two,friends,were,alone,Porthos,said,DArtagnan,who,will,attend,you,in,your,campaigns,Why,replied,Porthos,Mouston,of,course,This,was,a,blow,to,DArtagnan
He,could,already,see,the,intendants,beaming,smile,change,to,a,contortion,of,grief
But,he,said,Mouston,is,not,so,young,as,he,was,my,dear,fellow,besides,he,has,grown,fat,and,perhaps,has,lost,his,fitness,for,active,service,That,may,be,true,replied,Porthos,but,I,am,used,to,him,and,besides,he,wouldnt,be,willing,to,let,me,go,without,him,he,loves,me,so,much,Oh,blind,selflove,thought,DArtagnan
And,you,asked,Porthos,havent,you,still,in,your,service,your,old,lackey,that,good,that,brave,that,intelligentwhat,then,is,his,name,Planchetyes,I,have,found,him,again,but,he,is,lackey,no,longer,What,is,he,then,With,his,sixteen,hundred,francsyou,remember,the,sixteen,hundred,francs,he,earned,at,the,siege,of,La,Rochelle,by,carrying,a,letter,to,Lord,de,Winterhe,has,set,up,a,little,shop,in,the,Rue,des,Lombards,and,is,now,a,confectioner,Ah,he,is,a,confectioner,in,the,Rue,des,Lombards
How,does,it,happen,then,that,he,is,in,your,service,He,has,been,guilty,of,certain,escapades,and,fears,he,may,be,disturbed,And,the,musketeer,narrated,to,his,friend,Planchets,adventure
Well,said,Porthos,if,any,one,had,told,you,in,the,old,times,that,the,day,would,come,when,Planchet,would,rescue,Rochefort,and,that,you,would,protect,him,in,it,I,should,not,have,believed,him,but,men,are,changed,by,events,There,is,nothing,truer,than,that,said,Porthos,but,what,does,not,change,or,changes,for,the,better,is,wine
Taste,of,this,it,is,a,Spanish,wine,which,our,friend,Athos,thought,much,of,At,that,moment,the,steward,came,in,to,consult,his,master,upon,the,proceedings,of,the,next,day,and,also,with,regard,to,the,shooting,party,which,had,been,proposed
Tell,me,Mouston,said,Porthos,are,my,arms,in,good,condition,Your,arms,my,lordwhat,arms,Zounds
my,weapons,What,weapons,My,military,weapons,Yes,my,lord,at,any,rate,I,think,so,Make,sure,of,it,and,if,they,want,it,have,them,burnished,up
Which,is,my,best,cavalry,horse,Vulcan,And,the,best,hack,Bayard,What,horse,dost,thou,choose,for,thyself,I,like,Rustaud,my,lord,a,good,animal,whose,paces,suit,me,Strong,thinkest,thou,Half,Norman,half,Mecklenburger,will,go,night,and,day,That,will,do,for,us
Polish,up,or,make,some,one,else,polish,my,arms
Then,take,pistols,with,thee,and,a,huntingknife,Are,we,then,going,to,travel,my,lord,asked,Mousqueton,rather,uneasy
Something,better,still,Mouston,An,expedition,sir,asked,the,steward,whose,roses,began,to,change,into,lilies
We,are,going,to,return,to,the,service,Mouston,replied,Porthos,still,trying,to,restore,his,mustache,to,the,military,curl,it,had,long,lost
Into,the,servicethe,kings,service,Mousqueton,trembled,even,his,fat,smooth,cheeks,shook,as,he,spoke,and,he,looked,at,DArtagnan,with,an,air,of,reproach,he,staggered,and,his,voice,was,almost,choked
We,shall,serve,in,a,campaign,seek,out,all,sorts,of,adventuresreturn,in,short,to,our,former,life,These,last,words,fell,on,Mousqueton,like,a,thunderbolt
It,was,those,very,terrible,old,days,that,made,the,present,so,excessively,delightful,and,the,blow,was,so,great,he,rushed,out,overcome,and,forgot,to,shut,the,door
The,two,friends,remained,alone,to,speak,of,the,future,and,to,build,castles,in,the,air
The,good,wine,which,Mousqueton,had,placed,before,them,traced,out,in,glowing,drops,to,DArtagnan,a,fine,perspective,shining,with,quadruples,and,pistoles,and,showed,to,Porthos,a,blue,ribbon,and,a,ducal,mantle,they,were,in,fact,asleep,on,the,table,when,the,servants,came,to,light,them,to,their,bed
Mousqueton,was,however,somewhat,consoled,by,DArtagnan,who,the,next,day,told,him,that,in,all,probability,war,would,always,be,carried,on,in,the,heart,of,Paris,and,within,reach,of,the,Chateau,du,Vallon,which,was,near,Corbeil,or,Bracieux,which,was,near,Melun,and,of,Pierrefonds,which,was,between,Compiegne,and,VillarsCotterets
Oh,said,DArtagnan,we,dont,now,make,war,as,we,did,formerly
Today,its,a,sort,of,diplomatic,arrangement,ask,Planchet,Mousqueton,inquired,therefore,the,state,of,the,case,of,his,old,friend,who,confirmed,the,statement,of,DArtagnan
But,he,added,in,this,war,prisoners,stand,a,chance,of,being,hung,The,deuce,they,do,said,Mousqueton,I,think,I,should,like,the,siege,of,Rochelle,better,than,this,war,then,Porthos,meantime,asked,DArtagnan,to,give,him,his,instructions,how,to,proceed,on,his,journey
Four,days,replied,his,friend,are,necessary,to,reach,Blois,one,day,to,rest,there,three,or,four,days,to,return,to,Paris
Set,out,therefore,in,a,week,with,your,suite,and,go,to,the,Hotel,de,la,Chevrette,Rue,Tiquetonne,and,there,await,me,Thats,agreed,said,Porthos
As,to,myself,I,shall,go,around,to,see,Athos,for,though,I,dont,think,his,aid,worth,much,one,must,with,ones,friends,observe,all,due,politeness,said,DArtagnan
The,friends,then,took,leave,of,each,other,on,the,very,border,of,the,estate,of,Pierrefonds,to,which,Porthos,escorted,his,friend
At,least,DArtagnan,said,to,himself,as,he,took,the,road,to,VillarsCotterets,at,least,I,shall,not,be,alone,in,my,undertaking
That,devil,Porthos,is,a,man,of,prodigious,strength,still,if,Athos,joins,us,well,we,shall,be,three,of,us,to,laugh,at,Aramis,that,little,coxcomb,with,his,too,good,luck,At,VillarsCotterets,he,wrote,to,the,cardinal,My,LordI,have,already,one,man,to,offer,to,your,eminence,and,he,is,well,worth,twenty,men
I,am,just,setting,out,for,Blois
The,Comte,de,la,Fere,inhabits,the,Castle,of,Bragelonne,in,the,environs,of,that,city,Two,Angelic,Faces
The,road,was,long,but,the,horses,upon,which,DArtagnan,and,Planchet,rode,had,been,refreshed,in,the,well,supplied,stables,of,the,Lord,of,Bracieux,the,master,and,servant,rode,side,by,side,conversing,as,they,went,for,DArtagnan,had,by,degrees,thrown,off,the,master,and,Planchet,had,entirely,ceased,to,assume,the,manners,of,a,servant
He,had,been,raised,by,circumstances,to,the,rank,of,a,confidant,to,his,master
It,was,many,years,since,DArtagnan,had,opened,his,heart,to,any,one,it,happened,however,that,these,two,men,on,meeting,again,assimilated,perfectly
Planchet,was,in,truth,no,vulgar,companion,in,these,new,adventures,he,was,a,man,of,uncommonly,sound,sense
Without,courting,danger,he,never,shrank,from,an,encounter,in,short,he,had,been,a,soldier,and,arms,ennoble,a,man,it,was,therefore,on,the,footing,of,friends,that,DArtagnan,and,Planchet,arrived,in,the,neighborhood,of,Blois
Going,along,DArtagnan,shaking,his,head,said,I,know,that,my,going,to,Athos,is,useless,and,absurd,but,still,I,owe,this,courtesy,to,my,old,friend,a,man,who,had,in,him,material,for,the,most,noble,and,generous,of,characters,Oh,Monsieur,Athos,was,a,noble,gentleman,said,Planchet,was,he,not
Scattering,money,round,about,him,as,Heaven,sprinkles,rain
Do,you,remember,sir,that,duel,with,the,Englishman,in,the,inclosure,des,Carmes
how,lofty,how,magnificent,Monsieur,Athos,was,that,day,when,he,said,to,his,adversary,You,have,insisted,on,knowing,my,name,sir,so,much,the,worse,for,you,since,I,shall,be,obliged,to,kill,you,I,was,near,him,those,were,his,exact,words,when,he,stabbed,his,foe,as,he,said,he,would,and,his,adversary,fell,without,saying,Oh,Tis,a,noble,gentlemanMonsieur,Athos,Yes,true,as,Gospel,said,DArtagnan,but,one,single,fault,has,swallowed,up,all,these,fine,qualities,I,remember,well,said,Planchet,he,was,fond,of,drinkingin,truth,he,drank,but,not,as,other,men,drink
One,seemed,as,he,raised,the,wine,to,his,lips,to,hear,him,say,Come,juice,of,the,grape,and,chase,away,my,sorrows,And,how,he,used,to,break,the,stem,of,a,glass,or,the,neck,of,a,bottle
There,was,no,one,like,him,for,that,And,now,replied,DArtagnan,behold,the,sad,spectacle,that,awaits,us
This,noble,gentleman,with,his,lofty,glance,this,handsome,cavalier,so,brilliant,in,feats,of,arms,that,every,one,was,surprised,that,he,held,in,his,hand,a,sword,only,instead,of,a,baton,of,command
we,shall,find,him,changed,into,a,broken,down,old,man,with,garnet,nose,and,eyes,that,slobber,we,shall,find,him,extended,on,some,lawn,whence,he,will,look,at,us,with,a,languid,eye,and,peradventure,will,not,recognize,us
God,knows,Planchet,that,I,should,fly,from,a,sight,so,sad,if,I,did,not,wish,to,show,my,respect,for,the,illustrious,shadow,of,what,was,once,the,Comte,de,la,Fere,whom,we,loved,so,much,Planchet,shook,his,head,and,said,nothing
It,was,evident,that,he,shared,his,masters,apprehensions
And,then,resumed,DArtagnan,to,this,decrepitude,is,probably,added,poverty,for,he,must,have,neglected,the,little,that,he,had,and,the,dirty,scoundrel,Grimaud,more,taciturn,than,ever,and,still,more,drunken,than,his,masterstay,Planchet,it,breaks,my,heart,to,merely,think,of,it,I,fancy,myself,there,and,that,I,see,him,staggering,and,hear,him,stammering,said,Planchet,in,a,piteous,tone,but,at,all,events,we,shall,soon,know,the,real,state,of,things,for,I,imagine,that,those,lofty,walls,now,turning,ruby,in,the,setting,sun,are,the,walls,of,Blois,Probably,and,those,steeples,pointed,and,sculptured,that,we,catch,a,glimpse,of,yonder,are,similar,to,those,that,I,have,heard,described,at,Chambord,At,this,moment,one,of,those,heavy,wagons,drawn,by,bullocks,which,carry,the,wood,cut,in,the,fine,forests,of,the,country,to,the,ports,of,the,Loire,came,out,of,a,byroad,full,of,ruts,and,turned,on,that,which,the,two,horsemen,were,following
A,man,carrying,a,long,switch,with,a,nail,at,the,end,of,it,with,which,he,urged,on,his,slow,team,was,walking,with,the,cart
Whats,your,pleasure,gentlemen,replied,the,peasant,with,a,purity,of,accent,peculiar,to,the,people,of,that,district,and,which,might,have,put,to,shame,the,cultured,denizens,of,the,Sorbonne,and,the,Rue,de,lUniversite
We,are,looking,for,the,house,of,Monsieur,de,la,Fere,said,DArtagnan
The,peasant,took,off,his,hat,on,hearing,this,revered,name
Gentlemen,he,said,the,wood,that,I,am,carting,is,his,I,cut,it,in,his,copse,and,I,am,taking,it,to,the,chateau,DArtagnan,determined,not,to,question,this,man,he,did,not,wish,to,hear,from,another,what,he,had,himself,said,to,Planchet
The,chateau,he,said,to,himself,what,chateau
Athos,is,not,a,man,to,be,thwarted,he,like,Porthos,has,obliged,his,peasantry,to,call,him,my,lord,and,to,dignify,his,pettifogging,place,by,the,name,of,chateau
He,had,a,heavy,handdear,old,Athosafter,drinking,DArtagnan,after,asking,the,man,the,right,way,continued,his,route,agitated,in,spite,of,himself,at,the,idea,of,seeing,once,more,that,singular,man,whom,he,had,so,truly,loved,and,who,had,contributed,so,much,by,advice,and,example,to,his,education,as,a,gentleman
He,checked,by,degrees,the,speed,of,his,horse,and,went,on,his,head,drooping,as,if,in,deep,thought
Soon,as,the,road,turned,the,Chateau,de,la,Valliere,appeared,in,view,then,a,quarter,of,a,mile,beyond,a,white,house,encircled,in,sycamores,was,visible,at,the,farther,end,of,a,group,of,trees,which,spring,had,powdered,with,a,snow,of,flowers
On,beholding,this,house,DArtagnan,calm,as,he,was,in,general,felt,an,unusual,disturbance,within,his,heartso,powerful,during,the,whole,course,of,life,are,the,recollections,of,youth
He,proceeded,nevertheless,and,came,opposite,to,an,iron,gate,ornamented,in,the,taste,of,the,period
Through,the,gate,was,seen,kitchengardens,carefully,attended,to,a,spacious,courtyard,in,which,neighed,several,horses,held,by,valets,in,various,liveries,and,a,carriage,drawn,by,two,horses,of,the,country
This,cannot,be,the,establishment,of,Athos
suppose,he,is,dead,and,that,this,property,now,belongs,to,some,one,who,bears,his,name
Alight,Planchet,and,inquire,for,I,confess,that,I,have,scarcely,courage,so,to,do,Planchet,alighted
Thou,must,add,said,DArtagnan,that,a,gentleman,who,is,passing,by,wishes,to,have,the,honor,of,paying,his,respects,to,the,Comte,de,la,Fere,and,if,thou,art,satisfied,with,what,thou,hearest,then,mention,my,name,Planchet,leading,his,horse,by,the,bridle,drew,near,to,the,gate,and,rang,the,bell,and,immediately,a,servantman,with,white,hair,and,of,erect,stature,notwithstanding,his,age,presented,himself
Does,Monsieur,le,Comte,de,la,Fere,live,here,asked,Planchet
Yes,monsieur,it,is,here,he,lives,the,servant,replied,to,Planchet,who,was,not,in,livery
A,nobleman,retired,from,service,is,he,not,Yes,And,who,had,a,lackey,named,Grimaud,persisted,Planchet,who,had,prudently,considered,that,he,couldnt,have,too,much,information
Monsieur,Grimaud,is,absent,from,the,chateau,for,the,time,being,said,the,servitor,who,little,used,as,he,was,to,such,inquiries,began,to,examine,Planchet,from,head,to,foot
Then,cried,Planchet,joyously,I,see,well,that,it,is,the,same,Comte,de,la,Fere,whom,we,seek
Be,good,enough,to,open,to,me,for,I,wish,to,announce,to,monsieur,le,comte,that,my,master,one,of,his,friends,is,here,and,wishes,to,greet,him,Why,didnt,you,say,so,said,the,servitor,opening,the,gate
But,where,is,your,master,He,is,following,me,The,servitor,opened,the,gate,and,walked,before,Planchet,who,made,a,sign,to,DArtagnan
The,latter,his,heart,palpitating,more,than,ever,entered,the,courtyard,without,dismounting
Whilst,Planchet,was,standing,on,the,steps,before,the,house,he,heard,a,voice,say,Well,where,is,this,gentleman,and,why,do,they,not,bring,him,here,This,voice,the,sound,of,which,reached,DArtagnan,reawakened,in,his,heart,a,thousand,sentiments,a,thousand,recollections,that,he,had,forgotten
He,vaulted,hastily,from,his,horse,whilst,Planchet,with,a,smile,on,his,lips,advanced,toward,the,master,of,the,house
But,I,know,you,my,lad,said,Athos,appearing,on,the,threshold
Oh,yes,monsieur,le,comte,you,know,me,and,I,know,you
I,am,PlanchetPlanchet,whom,you,know,well,But,the,honest,servant,could,say,no,more,so,much,was,he,overcome,by,this,unexpected,interview
What,Planchet,is,Monsieur,dArtagnan,here,Here,I,am,my,friend,dear,Athos,cried,DArtagnan,in,a,faltering,voice,and,almost,staggering,from,agitation
At,these,words,a,visible,emotion,was,expressed,on,the,beautiful,countenance,and,calm,features,of,Athos
He,rushed,toward,DArtagnan,with,eyes,fixed,upon,him,and,clasped,him,in,his,arms
DArtagnan,equally,moved,pressed,him,also,closely,to,him,whilst,tears,stood,in,his,eyes
Athos,then,took,him,by,the,hand,and,led,him,into,the,drawingroom,where,there,were,several,people
I,present,to,you,he,said,Monsieur,le,Chevalier,DArtagnan,lieutenant,of,his,majestys,musketeers,a,devoted,friend,and,one,of,the,most,excellent,brave,gentlemen,that,I,have,ever,known,DArtagnan,received,the,compliments,of,those,who,were,present,in,his,own,way,and,whilst,the,conversation,became,general,he,looked,earnestly,at,Athos
Athos,was,scarcely,aged,at,all
His,fine,eyes,no,longer,surrounded,by,that,dark,line,which,nights,of,dissipation,pencil,too,infallibly,seemed,larger,more,liquid,than,ever
His,face,a,little,elongated,had,gained,in,calm,dignity,what,it,had,lost,in,feverish,excitement
His,hand,always,wonderfully,beautiful,and,strong,was,set,off,by,a,ruffle,of,lace,like,certain,hands,by,Titian,and,Vandyck
He,was,less,stiff,than,formerly
His,long,dark,hair,softly,powdered,here,and,there,with,silver,tendrils,fell,elegantly,over,his,shoulders,in,wavy,curls,his,voice,was,still,youthful,as,if,belonging,to,a,Hercules,of,twentyfive,and,his,magnificent,teeth,which,he,had,preserved,white,and,sound,gave,an,indescribable,charm,to,his,smile
Meanwhile,the,guests,seeing,that,the,two,friends,were,longing,to,be,alone,prepared,to,depart,when,a,noise,of,dogs,barking,resounded,through,the,courtyard,and,many,persons,said,at,the,same,moment,Ah
tis,Raoul,who,is,come,home,Athos,as,the,name,of,Raoul,was,pronounced,looked,inquisitively,at,DArtagnan,in,order,to,see,if,any,curiosity,was,painted,on,his,face
But,DArtagnan,was,still,in,confusion,and,turned,around,almost,mechanically,when,a,fine,young,man,of,fifteen,years,of,age,dressed,simply,but,in,perfect,taste,entered,the,room,raising,as,he,came,his,hat,adorned,with,a,long,plume,of,scarlet,feathers
Nevertheless,DArtagnan,was,struck,by,the,appearance,of,this,new,personage
It,seemed,to,explain,to,him,the,change,in,Athos,a,resemblance,between,the,boy,and,the,man,explained,the,mystery,of,this,regenerated,existence
Here,you,are,home,again,Raoul,said,the,comte
Yes,sir,replied,the,youth,with,deep,respect,and,I,have,performed,the,commission,that,you,gave,me,But,whats,the,matter,Raoul,said,Athos,very,anxiously
You,are,pale,and,agitated,Sir,replied,the,young,man,it,is,on,account,of,an,accident,which,has,happened,to,our,little,neighbor,To,Mademoiselle,de,la,Valliere,asked,Athos,quickly
What,is,it,cried,many,persons,present
She,was,walking,with,her,nurse,Marceline,in,the,place,where,the,woodmen,cut,the,wood,when,passing,on,horseback,I,stopped
She,saw,me,also,and,in,trying,to,jump,from,the,end,of,a,pile,of,wood,on,which,she,had,mounted,the,poor,child,fell,and,was,not,able,to,rise,again
I,fear,that,she,has,badly,sprained,her,ankle,Oh,heavens,cried,Athos
And,her,mother,Madame,de,SaintRemy,have,they,yet,told,her,of,it,No,sir,Madame,de,SaintRemy,is,at,Blois,with,the,Duchess,of,Orleans
I,am,afraid,that,what,was,first,done,was,unskillful,if,not,worse,than,useless
I,am,come,sir,to,ask,your,advice,Send,directly,to,Blois,Raoul,or,rather,take,horse,and,ride,immediately,yourself,Raoul,bowed
But,where,is,Louise,asked,the,comte
I,have,brought,her,here,sir,and,I,have,deposited,her,in,charge,of,Charlotte,who,till,better,advice,comes,has,bathed,the,foot,in,cold,wellwater,The,guests,now,all,took,leave,of,Athos,excepting,the,old,Duc,de,Barbe,who,as,an,old,friend,of,the,family,of,La,Valliere,went,to,see,little,Louise,and,offered,to,take,her,to,Blois,in,his,carriage
You,are,right,sir,said,Athos
She,will,be,the,sooner,with,her,mother
As,for,you,Raoul,I,am,sure,it,is,your,fault,some,giddiness,or,folly,No,sir,I,assure,you,muttered,Raoul,it,is,not,Oh,no,no,I,declare,it,is,not,cried,the,young,girl,while,Raoul,turned,pale,at,the,idea,of,his,being,perhaps,the,cause,of,her,disaster
Nevertheless,Raoul,you,must,go,to,Blois,and,you,must,make,your,excuses,and,mine,to,Madame,de,SaintRemy,The,youth,looked,pleased
He,again,took,in,his,strong,arms,the,little,girl,whose,pretty,golden,head,and,smiling,face,rested,on,his,shoulder,and,placed,her,gently,in,the,carriage,then,jumping,on,his,horse,with,the,elegance,of,a,firstrate,esquire,after,bowing,to,Athos,and,DArtagnan,he,went,off,close,by,the,door,of,the,carriage,on,somebody,inside,of,which,his,eyes,were,riveted
Whilst,this,scene,was,going,on,DArtagnan,remained,with,open,mouth,and,a,confused,gaze
Everything,had,turned,out,so,differently,from,what,he,expected,that,he,was,stupefied,with,wonder
Athos,who,had,been,observing,him,and,guessing,his,thoughts,took,his,arm,and,led,him,into,the,garden
Whilst,supper,is,being,prepared,he,said,smiling,you,will,not,my,friend,be,sorry,to,have,the,mystery,which,so,puzzles,you,cleared,up,True,monsieur,le,comte,replied,DArtagnan,who,felt,that,by,degrees,Athos,was,resuming,that,great,influence,which,aristocracy,had,over,him
First,and,foremost,dear,DArtagnan,we,have,no,title,such,as,count,here
When,I,call,you,chevalier,it,is,in,presenting,you,to,my,guests,that,they,may,know,who,you,are
But,to,you,DArtagnan,I,am,I,hope,still,dear,Athos,your,comrade,your,friend
Do,you,intend,to,stand,on,ceremony,because,you,are,less,attached,to,me,than,you,were,Oh
God,forbid,Then,let,us,be,as,we,used,to,be,let,us,be,open,with,each,other
You,are,surprised,at,what,you,see,here,Extremely,But,above,all,things,I,am,a,marvel,to,you,I,confess,it,I,am,still,young,am,I,not
Should,you,not,have,known,me,again,in,spite,of,my,eightandforty,years,of,age,On,the,contrary,I,do,not,find,you,the,same,person,at,all,I,understand,cried,Athos,with,a,gentle,blush
Everything,DArtagnan,even,folly,has,its,limit,Then,your,means,it,appears,are,improved,you,have,a,capital,houseyour,own,I,presume
You,have,a,park,and,horses,servants,Athos,smiled
Yes,I,inherited,this,little,property,when,I,quitted,the,army,as,I,told,you
The,park,is,twenty,acrestwenty,comprising,kitchengardens,and,a,common
I,have,two,horsesI,do,not,count,my,servants,bobtailed,nag
My,sporting,dogs,consist,of,two,pointers,two,harriers,and,two,setters
But,then,all,this,extravagance,is,not,for,myself,added,Athos,laughing
Yes,I,see,for,the,young,man,Raoul,said,DArtagnan
You,guess,aright,my,friend,this,youth,is,an,orphan,deserted,by,his,mother,who,left,him,in,the,house,of,a,poor,country,priest
It,is,Raoul,who,has,worked,in,me,the,change,you,see,I,was,dried,up,like,a,miserable,tree,isolated,attached,to,nothing,on,earth,it,was,only,a,deep,affection,that,could,make,me,take,root,again,and,drag,me,back,to,life
This,child,has,caused,me,to,recover,what,I,had,lost
I,had,no,longer,any,wish,to,live,for,myself,I,have,lived,for,him
I,have,corrected,the,vices,that,I,had,I,have,assumed,the,virtues,that,I,had,not
I,may,be,mistaken,but,I,believe,that,Raoul,will,be,as,accomplished,a,gentleman,as,our,degenerate,age,could,display,The,remembrance,of,Milady,recurred,to,DArtagnan
And,you,are,happy,he,said,to,his,friend
As,happy,as,it,is,allowed,to,one,of,Gods,creatures,to,be,on,this,earth,but,say,out,all,you,think,DArtagnan,for,you,have,not,yet,done,so,You,are,too,bad,Athos,one,can,hide,nothing,from,you,answered,DArtagnan
I,wished,to,ask,you,if,you,ever,feel,any,emotions,of,terror,resembling,Remorse
I,do,not,feel,remorse,because,that,woman,I,profoundly,hold,deserved,her,punishment
I,do,not,feel,remorse,because,had,we,allowed,her,to,live,she,would,have,persisted,in,her,work,of,destruction
But,I,do,not,mean,my,friend,that,we,were,right,in,what,we,did
Perhaps,all,blood,demands,some,expiation
Hers,had,been,accomplished,it,remains,possibly,for,us,to,accomplish,ours,I,have,sometimes,thought,as,you,do,Athos,She,had,a,son,that,unhappy,woman,Yes,Have,you,ever,heard,of,him,Never,He,must,be,about,twentythree,years,of,age,said,Athos,in,a,low,tone
I,often,think,of,that,young,man,DArtagnan,Strange
for,I,had,forgotten,him,said,the,lieutenant
Athos,smiled,the,smile,was,melancholy
And,Lord,de,Winterdo,you,know,anything,about,him,I,know,that,he,is,in,high,favor,with,Charles,I,The,fortunes,of,that,monarch,now,are,at,low,water
He,shed,the,blood,of,Strafford,that,confirms,what,I,said,just,nowblood,will,have,blood
And,the,queen,What,queen,Madame,Henrietta,of,England,daughter,of,Henry,IV,She,is,at,the,Louvre,as,you,know,Yes,and,I,hear,in,bitter,poverty
Her,daughter,during,the,severest,cold,was,obliged,for,want,of,fire,to,remain,in,bed
Do,you,grasp,that,said,Athos,shrugging,his,shoulders,the,daughter,of,Henry,IV
shivering,for,want,of,a,fagot
Why,did,she,not,ask,from,any,one,of,us,a,home,instead,of,from,Mazarin
She,should,have,wanted,nothing,Have,you,ever,seen,the,queen,of,England,inquired,DArtagnan
No,but,my,mother,as,a,child,saw,her
Did,I,ever,tell,you,that,my,mother,was,lady,of,honor,to,Marie,de,Medici,Never
You,know,Athos,you,never,spoke,much,of,such,matters,Ah,mon,Dieu,yes,you,are,right,Athos,replied,but,then,there,must,be,some,occasion,for,speaking,Porthos,wouldnt,have,waited,for,it,so,patiently,said,DArtagnan,with,a,smile
Every,one,according,to,his,nature,my,dear,DArtagnan
Porthos,in,spite,of,a,touch,of,vanity,has,many,excellent,qualities
Have,you,seen,him,I,left,him,five,days,ago,said,DArtagnan,and,he,portrayed,with,Gascon,wit,and,sprightliness,the,magnificence,of,Porthos,in,his,Chateau,of,Pierrefonds,nor,did,he,neglect,to,launch,a,few,arrows,of,wit,at,the,excellent,Monsieur,Mouston
I,sometimes,wonder,replied,Athos,smiling,at,that,gayety,which,recalled,the,good,old,days,that,we,could,form,an,association,of,men,who,would,be,after,twenty,years,of,separation,still,so,closely,bound,together
Friendship,throws,out,deep,roots,in,honest,hearts,DArtagnan
Believe,me,it,is,only,the,evilminded,who,deny,friendship,they,cannot,understand,it
And,Aramis,I,have,seen,him,also,said,DArtagnan,but,he,seemed,to,me,cold,Ah,you,have,seen,Aramis,said,Athos,turning,on,DArtagnan,a,searching,look
Why,it,is,a,veritable,pilgrimage,my,dear,friend,that,you,are,making,to,the,Temple,of,Friendship,as,the,poets,would,say,Why,yes,replied,DArtagnan,with,embarrassment
Aramis,you,know,continued,Athos,is,naturally,cold,and,then,he,is,always,involved,in,intrigues,with,women,I,believe,he,is,at,this,moment,in,a,very,complicated,one,said,DArtagnan
He,is,not,curious,thought,DArtagnan
Athos,not,only,failed,to,reply,he,even,changed,the,subject,of,conversation
You,see,said,he,calling,DArtagnans,attention,to,the,fact,that,they,had,come,back,to,the,chateau,after,an,hours,walk,we,have,made,a,tour,of,my,domains,All,is,charming,and,everything,savors,of,nobility,replied,DArtagnan
At,this,instant,they,heard,the,sound,of,horses,feet
Tis,Raoul,who,has,come,back,said,Athos,and,we,can,now,hear,how,the,poor,child,is,In,fact,the,young,man,appeared,at,the,gate,covered,with,dust,entered,the,courtyard,leaped,from,his,horse,which,he,consigned,to,the,charge,of,a,groom,and,then,went,to,greet,the,count,and,DArtagnan
Monsieur,said,Athos,placing,his,hand,on,DArtagnans,shoulder,monsieur,is,the,Chevalier,DArtagnan,of,whom,you,have,often,heard,me,speak,Raoul,Monsieur,said,the,young,man,saluting,again,and,more,profoundly,monsieur,le,comte,has,pronounced,your,name,before,me,as,an,example,whenever,he,wished,to,speak,of,an,intrepid,and,generous,gentleman,That,little,compliment,could,not,fail,to,move,DArtagnan
He,extended,a,hand,to,Raoul,and,said,My,young,friend,all,the,praises,that,are,given,me,should,be,passed,on,to,the,count,here,for,he,has,educated,me,in,everything,and,it,is,not,his,fault,that,his,pupil,profited,so,little,from,his,instructions
But,he,will,make,it,up,in,you,I,am,sure
I,like,your,manner,Raoul,and,your,politeness,has,touched,me,Athos,was,more,delighted,than,can,be,told
He,looked,at,DArtagnan,with,an,expression,of,gratitude,and,then,bestowed,on,Raoul,one,of,those,strange,smiles,of,which,children,are,so,proud,when,they,receive,them
Now,said,DArtagnan,to,himself,noticing,that,silent,play,of,countenance,I,am,sure,of,it,I,hope,the,accident,has,been,of,no,consequence,They,dont,yet,know,sir,on,account,of,the,swelling,but,the,doctor,is,afraid,some,tendon,has,been,injured,At,this,moment,a,little,boy,half,peasant,half,footboy,came,to,announce,supper
Athos,led,his,guest,into,a,diningroom,of,moderate,size,the,windows,of,which,opened,on,one,side,on,a,garden,on,the,other,on,a,hothouse,full,of,magnificent,flowers
DArtagnan,glanced,at,the,dinner,service
The,plate,was,magnificent,old,and,appertaining,to,the,family
DArtagnan,stopped,to,look,at,a,sideboard,on,which,was,a,superb,ewer,of,silver
That,workmanship,is,divine,he,exclaimed
Yes,a,chef,doeuvre,of,the,great,Florentine,sculptor,Benvenuto,Cellini,replied,Athos
What,battle,does,it,represent,That,of,Marignan,just,at,the,point,where,one,of,my,forefathers,is,offering,his,sword,to,Francis,I,who,has,broken,his
It,was,on,that,occasion,that,my,ancestor,Enguerrand,de,la,Fere,was,made,a,knight,of,the,Order,of,St,Michael,besides,which,the,king,fifteen,years,afterward,gave,him,also,this,ewer,and,a,sword,which,you,may,have,seen,formerly,in,my,house,also,a,lovely,specimen,of,workmanship
Men,were,giants,in,those,times,said,Athos,now,we,are,pigmies,in,comparison
Let,us,sit,down,to,supper
Call,Charles,he,added,addressing,the,boy,who,waited
My,good,Charles,I,particularly,recommend,to,your,care,Planchet,the,laquais,of,Monsieur,DArtagnan
He,likes,good,wine,now,you,have,the,key,of,the,cellar
He,has,slept,a,long,time,on,a,hard,bed,so,he,wont,object,to,a,soft,one,take,every,care,of,him,I,beg,of,you,Charles,bowed,and,retired
You,think,of,everything,said,DArtagnan,and,I,thank,you,for,Planchet,my,dear,Athos,Raoul,stared,on,hearing,this,name,and,looked,at,the,count,to,be,quite,sure,that,it,was,he,whom,the,lieutenant,thus,addressed
That,name,sounds,strange,to,you,said,Athos,smiling,it,was,my,nom,de,guerre,when,Monsieur,DArtagnan,two,other,gallant,friends,and,myself,performed,some,feats,of,arms,at,the,siege,of,La,Rochelle,under,the,deceased,cardinal,and,Monsieur,de,Bassompierre
My,friend,is,still,so,kind,as,to,address,me,by,that,old,and,well,beloved,appellation,which,makes,my,heart,glad,when,I,hear,it,Tis,an,illustrious,name,said,the,lieutenant,and,had,one,day,triumphal,honors,paid,to,it,What,do,you,mean,sir,inquired,Raoul
You,have,not,forgotten,St,Gervais,Athos,and,the,napkin,which,was,converted,into,a,banner,and,he,then,related,to,Raoul,the,story,of,the,bastion,and,Raoul,fancied,he,was,listening,to,one,of,those,deeds,of,arms,belonging,to,days,of,chivalry,so,gloriously,recounted,by,Tasso,and,Ariosto
DArtagnan,does,not,tell,you,Raoul,said,Athos,in,his,turn,that,he,was,reckoned,one,of,the,finest,swordsmen,of,his,timea,knuckle,of,iron,a,wrist,of,steel,a,sure,eye,and,a,glance,of,fire,thats,what,his,adversary,met,with
He,was,eighteen,only,three,years,older,than,you,are,Raoul,when,I,saw,him,set,to,work,pitted,against,tried,men,And,did,Monsieur,DArtagnan,come,off,the,conqueror,asked,the,young,man,with,glistening,eye
I,killed,one,man,if,I,recollect,rightly,replied,DArtagnan,with,a,look,of,inquiry,directed,to,Athos,another,I,disarmed,or,wounded,I,dont,remember,which,Wounded,said,Athos,it,was,a,phenomenon,of,skill,The,young,man,would,willingly,have,prolonged,this,conversation,far,into,the,night,but,Athos,pointed,out,to,him,that,his,guest,must,need,repose
DArtagnan,would,fain,have,declared,that,he,was,not,fatigued,but,Athos,insisted,on,his,retiring,to,his,chamber,conducted,thither,by,Raoul
DArtagnan,retired,to,bednot,to,sleep,but,to,think,over,all,he,had,heard,that,evening
Being,naturally,goodhearted,and,having,had,once,a,liking,for,Athos,which,had,grown,into,a,sincere,friendship,he,was,delighted,at,thus,meeting,a,man,full,of,intelligence,and,moral,strength,instead,of,a,drunkard
He,admitted,without,annoyance,the,continued,superiority,of,Athos,over,himself,devoid,as,he,was,of,that,jealousy,which,might,have,saddened,a,less,generous,disposition,he,was,delighted,also,that,the,high,qualities,of,Athos,appeared,to,promise,favorably,for,his,mission
Nevertheless,it,seemed,to,him,that,Athos,was,not,in,all,respects,sincere,and,frank
Who,was,the,youth,he,had,adopted,and,who,bore,so,striking,a,resemblance,to,him
What,could,explain,Athoss,having,reentered,the,world,and,the,extreme,sobriety,he,had,observed,at,table
The,absence,of,Grimaud,whose,name,had,never,once,been,uttered,by,Athos,gave,DArtagnan,uneasiness
It,was,evident,either,that,he,no,longer,possessed,the,confidence,of,his,friend,or,that,Athos,was,bound,by,some,invisible,chain,or,that,he,had,been,forewarned,of,the,lieutenants,visit
He,could,not,help,thinking,of,M,Rochefort,whom,he,had,seen,in,Notre,Dame,could,De,Rochefort,have,forestalled,him,with,Athos
Again,the,moderate,fortune,which,Athos,possessed,concealed,as,it,was,so,skillfully,seemed,to,show,a,regard,for,appearances,and,to,betray,a,latent,ambition,which,might,be,easily,aroused
The,clear,and,vigorous,intellect,of,Athos,would,render,him,more,open,to,conviction,than,a,less,able,man,would,be
He,would,enter,into,the,ministers,schemes,with,the,more,ardor,because,his,natural,activity,would,be,doubled,by,necessity
Resolved,to,seek,an,explanation,on,all,these,points,on,the,following,day,DArtagnan,in,spite,of,his,fatigue,prepared,for,an,attack,and,determined,that,it,should,take,place,after,breakfast
He,determined,to,cultivate,the,goodwill,of,the,youth,Raoul,and,either,whilst,fencing,with,him,or,when,out,shooting,to,extract,from,his,simplicity,some,information,which,would,connect,the,Athos,of,old,times,with,the,Athos,of,the,present
But,DArtagnan,at,the,same,time,being,a,man,of,extreme,caution,was,quite,aware,what,injury,he,should,do,himself,if,by,any,indiscretion,or,awkwardness,he,should,betray,has,manoeuvering,to,the,experienced,eye,of,Athos
Besides,to,tell,truth,whilst,DArtagnan,was,quite,disposed,to,adopt,a,subtle,course,against,the,cunning,of,Aramis,or,the,vanity,of,Porthos,he,was,ashamed,to,equivocate,with,Athos,truehearted,open,Athos
It,seemed,to,him,that,if,Porthos,and,Aramis,deemed,him,superior,to,them,in,the,arts,of,diplomacy,they,would,like,him,all,the,better,for,it,but,that,Athos,on,the,contrary,would,despise,him
why,is,not,Grimaud,the,taciturn,Grimaud,here,thought,DArtagnan,there,are,so,many,things,his,silence,would,have,told,me,with,Grimaud,silence,was,another,form,of,eloquence,There,reigned,a,perfect,stillness,in,the,house
DArtagnan,had,heard,the,door,shut,and,the,shutters,barred,the,dogs,became,in,their,turn,silent
At,last,a,nightingale,lost,in,a,thicket,of,shrubs,in,the,midst,of,its,most,melodious,cadences,had,fluted,low,and,lower,into,stillness,and,fallen,asleep
Not,a,sound,was,heard,in,the,castle,except,of,a,footstep,up,and,down,in,the,chamber,aboveas,he,supposed,the,bedroom,of,Athos
He,is,walking,about,and,thinking,thought,DArtagnan,but,of,what
It,is,impossible,to,know,everything,else,might,be,guessed,but,not,that,At,length,Athos,went,to,bed,apparently,for,the,noise,ceased
Silence,and,fatigue,together,overcame,DArtagnan,and,sleep,overtook,him,also
He,was,not,however,a,good,sleeper
Scarcely,had,dawn,gilded,his,window,curtains,when,he,sprang,out,of,bed,and,opened,the,windows
Somebody,he,perceived,was,in,the,courtyard,moving,stealthily
True,to,his,custom,of,never,passing,anything,over,that,it,was,within,his,power,to,know,DArtagnan,looked,out,of,the,window,and,perceived,the,close,red,coat,and,brown,hair,of,Raoul
The,young,man,was,opening,the,door,of,the,stable
He,then,with,noiseless,haste,took,out,the,horse,that,he,had,ridden,on,the,previous,evening,saddled,and,bridled,it,himself,and,led,the,animal,into,the,alley,to,the,right,of,the,kitchengarden,opened,a,side,door,which,conducted,him,to,a,bridle,road,shut,it,after,him,and,DArtagnan,saw,him,pass,by,like,a,dart,bending,as,he,went,beneath,the,pendent,flowery,branches,of,maple,and,acacia
The,road,as,DArtagnan,had,observed,was,the,way,to,Blois
So,thought,the,Gascon,heres,a,young,blade,who,has,already,his,love,affair,who,doesnt,at,all,agree,with,Athos,in,his,hatred,to,the,fair,sex
Hes,not,going,to,hunt,for,he,has,neither,dogs,nor,arms,hes,not,going,on,a,message,for,he,goes,secretly
Why,does,he,go,in,secret
Is,he,afraid,of,me,or,of,his,father
for,I,am,sure,the,count,is,his,father
I,shall,know,about,that,soon,for,I,shall,soon,speak,out,to,Athos,Day,was,now,advanced,all,the,noises,that,had,ceased,the,night,before,reawakened,one,after,the,other
The,bird,on,the,branch,the,dog,in,his,kennel,the,sheep,in,the,field,the,boats,moored,in,the,Loire,even,became,alive,and,vocal
The,latter,leaving,the,shore,abandoned,themselves,gaily,to,the,current
The,Gascon,gave,a,last,twirl,to,his,mustache,a,last,turn,to,his,hair,brushed,from,habit,the,brim,of,his,hat,with,the,sleeve,of,his,doublet,and,went,downstairs
Scarcely,had,he,descended,the,last,step,of,the,threshold,when,he,saw,Athos,bent,down,toward,the,ground,as,if,he,were,looking,for,a,crownpiece,in,the,dust
Goodmorning,my,dear,host,cried,DArtagnan
Goodday,to,you,have,you,slept,well,Excellently,Athos,but,what,are,you,looking,for
You,are,perhaps,a,tulip,fancier,My,dear,friend,if,I,am,you,must,not,laugh,at,me,for,being,so
In,the,country,people,alter,one,gets,to,like,without,knowing,it,all,those,beautiful,objects,that,God,causes,to,spring,from,the,earth,which,are,despised,in,cities
I,was,looking,anxiously,for,some,iris,roots,I,planted,here,close,to,this,reservoir,and,which,some,one,has,trampled,upon,this,morning
These,gardeners,are,the,most,careless,people,in,the,world,in,bringing,the,horse,out,to,the,water,theyve,allowed,him,to,walk,over,the,border,DArtagnan,began,to,smile
you,think,so,do,you,And,he,took,his,friend,along,the,alley,where,a,number,of,tracks,like,those,which,had,trampled,down,the,flowerbeds,were,visible
Here,are,the,horses,hoofs,again,it,seems,Athos,he,said,carelessly
Yes,indeed,the,marks,are,recent,Quite,so,replied,the,lieutenant
Who,went,out,this,morning,Athos,asked,uneasily
Has,any,horse,got,loose,Not,likely,answered,the,Gascon,these,marks,are,regular,Where,is,Raoul,asked,Athos,how,is,it,that,I,have,not,seen,him,Hush,exclaimed,DArtagnan,putting,his,finger,on,his,lips,and,he,related,what,he,had,seen,watching,Athos,all,the,while
Ah,hes,gone,to,Blois,the,poor,boy,Wherefore,Ah,to,inquire,after,the,little,La,Valliere,she,has,sprained,her,foot,you,know,You,think,he,has,I,am,sure,of,it,said,Athos,dont,you,see,that,Raoul,is,in,love,Indeed
with,whomwith,a,child,seven,years,old,Dear,friend,at,Raouls,age,the,heart,is,so,expansive,that,it,must,encircle,one,object,or,another,fancied,or,real
Well,his,love,is,half,real,half,fanciful
She,is,the,prettiest,little,creature,in,the,world,with,flaxen,hair,blue,eyesat,once,saucy,and,languishing,But,what,say,you,to,Raouls,fancy,NothingI,laugh,at,Raoul,but,this,first,desire,of,the,heart,is,imperious
I,remember,just,at,his,age,how,deep,in,love,I,was,with,a,Grecian,statue,which,our,good,king,then,Henry,IV,gave,my,father,insomuch,that,I,was,mad,with,grief,when,they,told,me,that,the,story,of,Pygmalion,was,nothing,but,a,fable,It,is,mere,want,of,occupation
You,do,not,make,Raoul,work,so,he,takes,his,own,way,of,employing,himself,Exactly,therefore,I,think,of,sending,him,away,from,here,You,will,be,wise,to,do,so,No,doubt,of,it,but,it,will,break,his,heart
So,long,as,three,or,four,years,ago,he,used,to,adorn,and,adore,his,little,idol,whom,he,will,some,day,fall,in,love,with,in,right,earnest,if,he,remains,here
The,parents,of,little,La,Valliere,have,for,a,long,time,perceived,and,been,amused,at,it,now,they,begin,to,look,concerned,Nonsense
However,Raoul,must,be,diverted,from,this,fancy
Send,him,away,or,you,will,never,make,a,man,of,him,I,think,I,shall,send,him,to,Paris,So,thought,DArtagnan,and,it,seemed,to,him,that,the,moment,for,attack,had,arrived
Suppose,he,said,we,roughly,chalk,out,a,career,for,this,young,man
I,wish,to,consult,you,about,some,thing,Do,so,Do,you,think,it,is,time,for,us,to,enter,the,service,But,are,you,not,still,in,the,serviceyou,DArtagnan,I,mean,active,service

Ah,devil,take,it,you,speak,in,earnest,And,must,have,a,definite,answer
There,is,but,one,person,or,rather,one,cause,to,whom,a,man,like,me,can,be,usefulthat,of,the,king,Exactly,answered,the,musketeer
Yes,but,let,us,understand,each,other,returned,Athos,seriously
If,by,the,cause,of,the,king,you,mean,that,of,Monsieur,de,Mazarin,we,do,not,understand,each,other,I,dont,say,exactly,answered,the,Gascon,confused
Come,DArtagnan,dont,let,us,play,a,sidelong,game,your,hesitation,your,evasion,tells,me,at,once,on,whose,side,you,are,for,that,party,no,one,dares,openly,to,recruit,and,when,people,recruit,for,it,it,is,with,averted,eyes,and,humble,voice,Ah

I,thank,you,DArtagnan,You,are,more,impetuous,than,you,were,returned,DArtagnan
Age,has,warmed,not,chilled,your,blood
Who,informed,you,this,was,the,master,I,propose,to,you
Devil,take,it,he,muttered,to,himself,dont,let,me,betray,my,secrets,to,a,man,not,inclined,to,entertain,them,Well,then,said,Athos,what,are,your,schemes
You,live,on,your,estate,happy,in,golden,mediocrity
Porthos,has,perhaps,sixty,thousand,francs,income
Aramis,has,always,fifty,duchesses,quarreling,over,the,priest,as,they,quarreled,formerly,over,the,musketeer,but,Iwhat,have,I,in,the,world
I,have,worn,my,cuirass,these,twenty,years,kept,down,in,this,inferior,rank,without,going,forward,or,backward,hardly,half,living
when,there,is,some,idea,of,being,resuscitated,you,say,hes,a,scoundrel,an,impudent,fellow,a,miser,a,bad,master
I,am,of,your,opinion,but,find,me,a,better,one,or,give,me,the,means,of,living,Athos,was,for,a,few,moments,thoughtful
DArtagnan,is,for,Mazarin,he,said,to,himself
From,that,moment,he,grew,very,guarded
On,his,side,DArtagnan,became,more,cautious,also
You,spoke,to,me,Athos,resumed,of,Porthos,have,you,persuaded,him,to,seek,his,fortune
But,he,has,wealth,I,believe,already,Doubtless,he,has
But,such,is,man,we,always,want,something,more,than,we,already,have,What,does,Porthos,wish,for,To,be,a,baron,Ah,true
Tis,true,thought,the,Gascon,where,has,he,heard,it
if,I,knew,that,he,did,I,should,know,all,The,conversation,was,interrupted,by,the,entrance,of,Raoul
Is,our,little,neighbor,worse,asked,DArtagnan,seeing,a,look,of,vexation,on,the,face,of,the,youth
Ah,sir,replied,Raoul,her,fall,is,a,very,serious,one,and,without,any,ostensible,injury,the,physician,fears,she,will,be,lame,for,life,This,is,terrible,said,Athos
And,what,makes,me,all,the,more,wretched,sir,is,that,I,was,the,cause,of,this,misfortune,How,so,asked,Athos
It,was,to,run,to,meet,me,that,she,leaped,from,that,pile,of,wood,Theres,only,one,remedy,dear,Raoulthat,is,to,marry,her,as,a,compensation,remarked,DArtagnan
Ah,sir,answered,Raoul,you,joke,about,a,real,misfortune,that,is,cruel,indeed,The,good,understanding,between,the,two,friends,was,not,in,the,least,altered,by,the,mornings,skirmish
They,breakfasted,with,a,good,appetite,looking,now,and,then,at,poor,Raoul,who,with,moist,eyes,and,a,full,heart,scarcely,ate,at,all
After,breakfast,two,letters,arrived,for,Athos,who,read,them,with,profound,attention,whilst,DArtagnan,could,not,restrain,himself,from,jumping,up,several,times,on,seeing,him,read,these,epistles,in,one,of,which,there,being,at,the,time,a,very,strong,light,he,perceived,the,fine,writing,of,Aramis
The,other,was,in,a,feminine,hand,long,and,crossed
Come,said,DArtagnan,to,Raoul,seeing,that,Athos,wished,to,be,alone,come,let,us,take,a,turn,in,the,fencing,gallery,that,will,amuse,you,And,they,both,went,into,a,low,room,where,there,were,foils,gloves,masks,breastplates,and,all,the,accessories,for,a,fencing,match
In,a,quarter,of,an,hour,Athos,joined,them,and,at,the,same,moment,Charles,brought,in,a,letter,for,DArtagnan,which,a,messenger,had,just,desired,might,be,instantly,delivered
It,was,now,Athoss,turn,to,take,a,sly,look
DArtagnan,read,the,letter,with,apparent,calmness,and,said,shaking,his,head,See,dear,friend,what,it,is,to,belong,to,the,army
Faith,you,are,indeed,right,not,to,return,to,it
Monsieur,de,Tréville,is,ill,so,my,company,cant,do,without,me,there
my,leave,is,at,an,end,Do,you,return,to,Paris,asked,Athos,quickly
yes,but,why,dont,you,come,there,also,Athos,colored,a,little,and,answered,Should,I,go,I,shall,be,delighted,to,see,you,there,Halloo,Planchet,cried,the,Gascon,from,the,door,we,must,set,out,in,ten,minutes,give,the,horses,some,hay,Then,turning,to,Athos,he,added,I,seem,to,miss,something,here
I,am,really,sorry,to,go,away,without,having,seen,Grimaud,Grimaud,replied,Athos
Im,surprised,you,have,never,so,much,as,asked,after,him
I,have,lent,him,to,a,friend,Who,will,understand,the,signs,he,makes,returned,DArtagnan
I,hope,so,The,friends,embraced,cordially,DArtagnan,pressed,Raouls,hand
Will,you,not,come,with,me,he,said,I,shall,pass,by,Blois,Raoul,turned,toward,Athos,who,showed,him,by,a,secret,sign,that,he,did,not,wish,him,to,go
No,monsieur,replied,the,young,man,I,will,remain,with,monsieur,le,comte,Adieu,then,to,both,my,good,friends,said,DArtagnan,may,God,preserve,you
as,we,used,to,say,when,we,said,goodbye,to,each,other,in,the,late,cardinals,time,Athos,waved,his,hand,Raoul,bowed,and,DArtagnan,and,Planchet,set,out
The,count,followed,them,with,his,eyes,his,hands,resting,on,the,shoulders,of,the,youth,whose,height,was,almost,equal,to,his,own,but,as,soon,as,they,were,out,of,sight,he,said,Raoul,we,set,out,tonight,for,Paris,Eh,cried,the,young,man,turning,pale
You,may,go,and,offer,your,adieux,and,mine,to,Madame,de,SaintRemy
I,shall,wait,for,you,here,till,seven,The,young,man,bent,low,with,an,expression,of,sorrow,and,gratitude,mingled,and,retired,in,order,to,saddle,his,horse
As,to,DArtagnan,scarcely,on,his,side,was,he,out,of,sight,when,he,drew,from,his,pocket,a,letter,which,he,read,over,again,Return,immediately,to,ParisJ
M,The,epistle,is,laconic,said,DArtagnan,and,if,there,had,not,been,a,postscript,probably,I,should,not,have,understood,it,but,happily,there,is,a,postscript,And,he,read,that,welcome,postscript,which,made,him,forget,the,abruptness,of,the,letter
SGo,to,the,kings,treasurer,at,Blois,tell,him,your,name,and,show,him,this,letter,you,will,receive,two,hundred,pistoles,Assuredly,said,DArtagnan,I,admire,this,piece,of,prose
The,cardinal,writes,better,than,I,thought
Come,Planchet,let,us,pay,a,visit,to,the,kings,treasurer,and,then,set,off,Toward,Paris,sir,Toward,Paris,And,they,set,out,at,as,hard,a,canter,as,their,horses,could,maintain
The,circumstances,that,had,hastened,the,return,of,DArtagnan,to,Paris,were,as,follows,One,evening,when,Mazarin,according,to,custom,went,to,visit,the,queen,in,passing,the,guardchamber,he,heard,loud,voices,wishing,to,know,on,what,topic,the,soldiers,were,conversing,he,approached,with,his,wonted,wolflike,step,pushed,open,the,door,and,put,his,head,close,to,the,chink
There,was,a,dispute,among,the,guards
I,tell,you,one,of,them,was,saying,that,if,Coysel,predicted,that,tis,as,good,as,true,I,know,nothing,about,it,but,I,have,heard,say,that,hes,not,only,an,astrologer,but,a,magician,Deuce,take,it,friend,if,hes,one,of,thy,friends,thou,wilt,ruin,him,in,saying,so,Why,Because,he,may,be,tried,for,it,Ah
they,dont,burn,sorcerers,nowadays,No
Tis,not,a,long,time,since,the,late,cardinal,burnt,Urban,Grandier,though,My,friend,Urban,Grandier,wasnt,a,sorcerer,he,was,a,learned,man
He,didnt,predict,the,future,he,knew,the,pastoften,a,more,dangerous,thing,Mazarin,nodded,an,assent,but,wishing,to,know,what,this,prediction,was,about,which,they,disputed,he,remained,in,the,same,place
I,dont,say,resumed,the,guard,that,Coysel,is,not,a,sorcerer,but,I,say,that,if,his,prophecy,gets,wind,its,a,sure,way,to,prevent,its,coming,true,How,so,Why,in,this,way,if,Coysel,says,loud,enough,for,the,cardinal,to,hear,him,on,such,or,such,a,day,such,a,prisoner,will,escape,tis,plain,that,the,cardinal,will,take,measures,of,precaution,and,that,the,prisoner,will,not,escape,Good,Lord,said,another,guard,who,might,have,been,thought,asleep,on,a,bench,but,who,had,lost,not,a,syllable,of,the,conversation,do,you,suppose,that,men,can,escape,their,destiny
If,it,is,written,yonder,in,Heaven,that,the,Duc,de,Beaufort,is,to,escape,he,will,escape,and,all,the,precautions,of,the,cardinal,will,not,prevent,it,Mazarin,started
He,was,an,Italian,and,therefore,superstitious
He,walked,straight,into,the,midst,of,the,guards,who,on,seeing,him,were,silent
What,were,you,saying,he,asked,with,his,flattering,manner,that,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,had,escaped,were,you,not,Oh,no,my,lord,said,the,incredulous,soldier
Hes,well,guarded,now,we,only,said,he,would,escape,Who,said,so,Repeat,your,story,Saint,Laurent,replied,the,man,turning,to,the,originator,of,the,tale
My,lord,said,the,guard,I,have,simply,mentioned,the,prophecy,I,heard,from,a,man,named,Coysel,who,believes,that,be,he,ever,so,closely,watched,and,guarded,the,Duke,of,Beaufort,will,escape,before,Whitsuntide,Coysel,is,a,madman,returned,the,cardinal
No,replied,the,soldier,tenacious,in,his,credulity,he,has,foretold,many,things,which,have,come,to,pass,for,instance,that,the,queen,would,have,a,son,that,Monsieur,Coligny,would,be,killed,in,a,duel,with,the,Duc,de,Guise,and,finally,that,the,coadjutor,would,be,made,cardinal
the,queen,has,not,only,one,son,but,two,then,Monsieur,de,Coligny,was,killed,and,Yes,said,Mazarin,but,the,coadjutor,is,not,yet,made,cardinal,No,my,lord,but,he,will,be,answered,the,guard
Mazarin,made,a,grimace,as,if,he,meant,to,say,But,he,does,not,wear,the,cardinals,cap,then,he,added,So,my,friend,its,your,opinion,that,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,will,escape,Thats,my,idea,my,lord,and,if,your,eminence,were,to,offer,to,make,me,at,this,moment,governor,of,the,castle,of,Vincennes,I,should,refuse,it
After,Whitsuntide,it,would,be,another,thing,There,is,nothing,so,convincing,as,a,firm,conviction
It,has,its,own,effect,upon,the,most,incredulous,and,far,from,being,incredulous,Mazarin,was,superstitious
He,went,away,thoughtful,and,anxious,and,returned,to,his,own,room,where,he,summoned,Bernouin,and,desired,him,to,fetch,thither,in,the,morning,the,special,guard,he,had,placed,over,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,and,to,awaken,him,whenever,he,should,arrive
The,guard,had,in,fact,touched,the,cardinal,in,the,tenderest,point
During,the,whole,five,years,in,which,the,Duc,de,Beaufort,had,been,in,prison,not,a,day,had,passed,in,which,the,cardinal,had,not,felt,a,secret,dread,of,his,escape
It,was,not,possible,as,he,knew,well,to,confine,for,the,whole,of,his,life,the,grandson,of,Henry,IV,especially,when,this,young,prince,was,scarcely,thirty,years,of,age
But,however,and,whensoever,he,did,escape,what,hatred,he,must,cherish,against,him,to,whom,he,owed,his,long,imprisonment,who,had,taken,him,rich,brave,glorious,beloved,by,women,feared,by,men,to,cut,off,his,lifes,best,happiest,years,for,it,is,not,life,it,is,merely,existence,in,prison
Meantime,Mazarin,redoubled,his,surveillance,over,the,duke
But,like,the,miser,in,the,fable,he,could,not,sleep,for,thinking,of,his,treasure
Often,he,awoke,in,the,night,suddenly,dreaming,that,he,had,been,robbed,of,Monsieur,de,Beaufort
Then,he,inquired,about,him,and,had,the,vexation,of,hearing,that,the,prisoner,played,drank,sang,but,that,whilst,playing,drinking,singing,he,often,stopped,short,to,vow,that,Mazarin,should,pay,dear,for,all,the,amusements,he,had,forced,him,to,enter,into,at,Vincennes
So,much,did,this,one,idea,haunt,the,cardinal,even,in,his,sleep,that,when,at,seven,in,the,morning,Bernouin,came,to,arouse,him,his,first,words,were,Well,whats,the,matter
Has,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,escaped,from,Vincennes,I,do,not,think,so,my,lord,said,Bernouin,but,you,will,hear,about,him,for,La,Ramee,is,here,and,awaits,the,commands,of,your,eminence,Tell,him,to,come,in,said,Mazarin,arranging,his,pillows,so,that,he,might,receive,the,visitor,sitting,up,in,bed
The,officer,entered,a,large,fat,man,with,an,open,physiognomy
His,air,of,perfect,serenity,made,Mazarin,uneasy
Do,you,know,what,they,are,saying,here,No,your,eminence,Well,they,say,that,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,is,going,to,escape,from,Vincennes,if,he,has,not,done,so,already,The,officers,face,expressed,complete,stupefaction
He,opened,at,once,his,little,eyes,and,his,great,mouth,to,inhale,better,the,joke,his,eminence,deigned,to,address,to,him,and,ended,by,a,burst,of,laughter,so,violent,that,his,great,limbs,shook,in,hilarity,as,they,would,have,done,in,an,ague
Your,eminence,does,not,then,know,where,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,is,Yes,I,do,sir,in,the,donjon,of,Vincennes,Yes,sir,in,a,room,the,walls,of,which,are,seven,feet,thick,with,grated,windows,each,bar,as,thick,as,my,arm,Sir,replied,Mazarin,with,perseverance,one,may,penetrate,through,a,wall,with,a,watchspring,one,may,saw,through,an,iron,bar,Then,my,lord,does,not,know,that,there,are,eight,guards,about,him,four,in,his,chamber,four,in,the,antechamber,and,that,they,never,leave,him,But,he,leaves,his,room,he,plays,at,tennis,at,the,Mall,Sir,those,amusements,are,allowed,but,if,your,eminence,wishes,it,we,will,discontinue,the,permission,No,no,cried,Mazarin,fearing,that,should,his,prisoner,ever,leave,his,prison,he,would,be,the,more,exasperated,against,him,if,he,thus,retrenched,his,amusement
He,then,asked,with,whom,he,played
My,lord,either,with,the,officers,of,the,guard,with,the,other,prisoners,or,with,me,But,does,he,not,approach,the,walls,while,playing,Your,eminence,doesnt,know,those,walls,they,are,sixty,feet,high,and,I,doubt,if,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,is,sufficiently,weary,of,life,to,risk,his,neck,by,jumping,off,Hum,said,the,cardinal,beginning,to,feel,more,comfortable
You,mean,to,say,then,my,dear,Monsieur,la,Ramee,That,unless,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,can,contrive,to,metamorphose,himself,into,a,little,bird,I,will,continue,answerable,for,him,Take,care
you,assert,a,great,deal,said,Mazarin
Monsieur,de,Beaufort,told,the,guards,who,took,him,to,Vincennes,that,he,had,often,thought,what,he,should,do,in,case,he,were,put,into,prison,and,that,he,had,found,out,forty,ways,of,escaping,My,lord,if,among,these,forty,there,had,been,one,good,way,he,would,have,been,out,long,ago,Come,come,not,such,a,fool,as,I,fancied,thought,Mazarin
Besides,my,lord,must,remember,that,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,is,governor,of,Vincennes,continued,La,Ramee,and,that,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,is,not,friendly,to,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,Yes,but,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,is,sometimes,absent,When,he,is,absent,I,am,there,But,when,you,leave,him,for,instance,Oh
when,I,leave,him,I,place,in,my,stead,a,bold,fellow,who,aspires,to,be,his,majestys,special,guard
I,promise,you,he,keeps,a,good,watch,over,the,prisoner
During,the,three,weeks,that,he,has,been,with,me,I,have,only,had,to,reproach,him,with,one,thingbeing,too,severe,with,the,prisoners,And,who,is,this,Cerberus,A,certain,Monsieur,Grimaud,my,lord,And,what,was,he,before,he,went,to,Vincennes,He,was,in,the,country,as,I,was,told,by,the,person,who,recommended,him,to,me,And,who,recommended,this,man,to,you,The,steward,of,the,Duc,de,Grammont,He,is,not,a,gossip,I,hope,Lord,a,mercy,my,lord
I,thought,for,a,long,time,that,he,was,dumb,he,answers,only,by,signs
It,seems,his,former,master,accustomed,him,to,that,Well,dear,Monsieur,la,Ramee,replied,the,cardinal,let,him,prove,a,true,and,thankful,keeper,and,we,will,shut,our,eyes,upon,his,rural,misdeeds,and,put,on,his,back,a,uniform,to,make,him,respectable,and,in,the,pockets,of,that,uniform,some,pistoles,to,drink,to,the,kings,health,Mazarin,was,large,in,promisesquite,unlike,the,virtuous,Monsieur,Grimaud,so,bepraised,by,La,Ramee,for,he,said,nothing,and,did,much
The,cardinal,therefore,got,up,perfumed,himself,dressed,and,went,to,the,queen,to,tell,her,what,had,detained,him
The,queen,who,was,scarcely,less,afraid,of,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,than,the,cardinal,himself,and,who,was,almost,as,superstitious,as,he,was,made,him,repeat,word,for,word,all,La,Ramees,praises,of,his,deputy
Then,when,the,cardinal,had,ended,Alas,sir
why,have,we,not,a,Grimaud,near,every,prince,Patience,replied,Mazarin,with,his,Italian,smile,that,may,happen,one,day,but,in,the,meantime,Well,in,the,meantime,I,shall,still,take,precautions,And,he,wrote,to,DArtagnan,to,hasten,his,return
Duc,de,Beaufort,amused,his,Leisure,Hours,in,the,Donjon,of,Vincennes
The,captive,who,was,the,source,of,so,much,alarm,to,the,cardinal,and,whose,means,of,escape,disturbed,the,repose,of,the,whole,court,was,wholly,unconscious,of,the,terror,he,caused,at,the,Palais,Royal
He,had,found,himself,so,strictly,guarded,that,he,soon,perceived,the,fruitlessness,of,any,attempt,at,escape
His,vengeance,therefore,consisted,in,coining,curses,on,the,head,of,Mazarin,he,even,tried,to,make,some,verses,on,him,but,soon,gave,up,the,attempt,for,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,had,not,only,not,received,from,Heaven,the,gift,of,versifying,he,had,the,greatest,difficulty,in,expressing,himself,in,prose
The,duke,was,the,grandson,of,Henry,IV
and,Gabrielle,dEstreesas,goodnatured,as,brave,as,proud,and,above,all,as,Gascon,as,his,ancestor,but,less,elaborately,educated
After,having,been,for,some,time,after,the,death,of,Louis,XIII
the,favorite,the,confidant,the,first,man,in,short,at,the,court,he,had,been,obliged,to,yield,his,place,to,Mazarin,and,so,became,the,second,in,influence,and,favor,and,eventually,as,he,was,stupid,enough,to,be,vexed,at,this,change,of,position,the,queen,had,had,him,arrested,and,sent,to,Vincennes,in,charge,of,Guitant,who,made,his,appearance,in,these,pages,in,the,beginning,of,this,history,and,whom,we,shall,see,again
It,is,understood,of,course,that,when,we,say,the,queen,Mazarin,is,meant
During,the,five,years,of,this,seclusion,which,would,have,improved,and,matured,the,intellect,of,any,other,man,M,de,Beaufort,had,he,not,affected,to,brave,the,cardinal,despise,princes,and,walk,alone,without,adherents,or,disciples,would,either,have,regained,his,liberty,or,made,partisans
But,these,considerations,never,occurred,to,the,duke,and,every,day,the,cardinal,received,fresh,accounts,of,him,which,were,as,unpleasant,as,possible,to,the,minister
After,having,failed,in,poetry,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,tried,drawing
He,drew,portraits,with,a,piece,of,coal,of,the,cardinal,and,as,his,talents,did,not,enable,him,to,produce,a,very,good,likeness,he,wrote,under,the,picture,that,there,might,be,little,doubt,regarding,the,original,Portrait,of,the,Illustrious,Coxcomb,Mazarin,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,the,governor,of,Vincennes,waited,upon,the,duke,to,request,that,he,would,amuse,himself,in,some,other,way,or,that,at,all,events,if,he,drew,likenesses,he,would,not,put,mottoes,underneath,them
The,next,day,the,prisoners,room,was,full,of,pictures,and,mottoes
Monsieur,de,Beaufort,in,common,with,many,other,prisoners,was,bent,upon,doing,things,that,were,prohibited,and,the,only,resource,the,governor,had,was,one,day,when,the,duke,was,playing,at,tennis,to,efface,all,these,drawings,consisting,chiefly,of,profiles
M,de,Beaufort,did,not,venture,to,draw,the,cardinals,fat,face
The,duke,thanked,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,for,having,as,he,said,cleaned,his,drawingpaper,for,him,he,then,divided,the,walls,of,his,room,into,compartments,and,dedicated,each,of,these,compartments,to,some,incident,in,Mazarins,life
In,one,was,depicted,the,Illustrious,Coxcomb,receiving,a,shower,of,blows,from,Cardinal,Bentivoglio,whose,servant,he,had,been,another,the,Illustrious,Mazarin,acting,the,part,of,Ignatius,Loyola,in,a,tragedy,of,that,name,a,third,the,Illustrious,Mazarin,stealing,the,portfolio,of,prime,minister,from,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,who,had,expected,to,have,it,a,fourth,the,Illustrious,Coxcomb,Mazarin,refusing,to,give,Laporte,the,young,kings,valet,clean,sheets,and,saving,that,it,was,quite,enough,for,the,king,of,France,to,have,clean,sheets,every,three,months,The,governor,of,course,thought,proper,to,threaten,his,prisoner,that,if,he,did,not,give,up,drawing,such,pictures,he,should,be,obliged,to,deprive,him,of,all,the,means,of,amusing,himself,in,that,manner
To,this,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,replied,that,since,every,opportunity,of,distinguishing,himself,in,arms,was,taken,from,him,he,wished,to,make,himself,celebrated,in,the,arts,since,he,could,not,be,a,Bayard,he,would,become,a,Raphael,or,a,Michael,Angelo
Nevertheless,one,day,when,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,was,walking,in,the,meadow,his,fire,was,put,out,his,charcoal,all,removed,taken,away,and,thus,his,means,of,drawing,utterly,destroyed
The,poor,duke,swore,fell,into,a,rage,yelled,and,declared,that,they,wished,to,starve,him,to,death,as,they,had,starved,the,Marechal,Ornano,and,the,Grand,Prior,of,Vendome,but,he,refused,to,promise,that,he,would,not,make,any,more,drawings,and,remained,without,any,fire,in,the,room,all,the,winter
His,next,act,was,to,purchase,a,dog,from,one,of,his,keepers
With,this,animal,which,he,called,Pistache,he,was,often,shut,up,for,hours,alone,superintending,as,every,one,supposed,its,education
At,last,when,Pistache,was,sufficiently,well,trained,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,invited,the,governor,and,officers,of,Vincennes,to,attend,a,representation,which,he,was,going,to,have,in,his,apartment
The,party,assembled,the,room,was,lighted,with,waxlights,and,the,prisoner,with,a,bit,of,plaster,he,had,taken,out,of,the,wall,of,his,room,had,traced,a,long,white,line,representing,a,cord,on,the,floor
Pistache,on,a,signal,from,his,master,placed,himself,on,this,line,raised,himself,on,his,hind,paws,and,holding,in,his,front,paws,a,wand,with,which,clothes,used,to,be,beaten,he,began,to,dance,upon,the,line,with,as,many,contortions,as,a,ropedancer
Having,been,several,times,up,and,down,it,he,gave,the,wand,back,to,his,master,and,began,without,hesitation,to,perform,the,same,evolutions,over,again
The,intelligent,creature,was,received,with,loud,applause
The,first,part,of,the,entertainment,being,concluded,Pistache,was,desired,to,say,what,oclock,it,was,he,was,shown,Monsieur,de,Chavignys,watch,it,was,then,halfpast,six,the,dog,raised,and,dropped,his,paw,six,times,the,seventh,he,let,it,remain,upraised
Nothing,could,be,better,done,a,sundial,could,not,have,shown,the,hour,with,greater,precision
Then,the,question,was,put,to,him,who,was,the,best,jailer,in,all,the,prisons,in,France
The,dog,performed,three,evolutions,around,the,circle,and,laid,himself,with,the,deepest,respect,at,the,feet,of,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,who,at,first,seemed,inclined,to,like,the,joke,and,laughed,long,and,loud,but,a,frown,succeeded,and,he,bit,his,lips,with,vexation
Then,the,duke,put,to,Pistache,this,difficult,question,who,was,the,greatest,thief,in,the,world
Pistache,went,again,around,the,circle,but,stopped,at,no,one,and,at,last,went,to,the,door,and,began,to,scratch,and,bark
See,gentlemen,said,M,de,Beaufort,this,wonderful,animal,not,finding,here,what,I,ask,for,seeks,it,out,of,doors,you,shall,however,have,his,answer
Is,not,the,greatest,thief,in,the,world,Monsieur,the,kings,secretary,Le,Camus,who,came,to,Paris,with,twenty,francs,in,his,pocket,and,who,now,possesses,ten,millions,The,dog,shook,his,head
Then,is,it,not,resumed,the,duke,the,Superintendent,Emery,who,gave,his,son,when,he,was,married,three,hundred,thousand,francs,and,a,house,compared,to,which,the,Tuileries,are,a,heap,of,ruins,and,the,Louvre,a,paltry,building,The,dog,again,shook,his,head,as,if,to,say,no,Then,said,the,prisoner,lets,think,who,it,can,be
Can,it,be,can,it,possibly,be,the,Illustrious,Coxcomb,Mazarin,de,Piscina,hey,Pistache,made,violent,signs,that,it,was,by,raising,and,lowering,his,head,eight,or,ten,times,successively
Gentlemen,you,see,said,the,duke,to,those,present,who,dared,not,even,smile,that,it,is,the,Illustrious,Coxcomb,who,is,the,greatest,thief,in,the,world,at,least,according,to,Pistache,Let,us,go,on,to,another,of,his,exercises,Gentlementhere,was,a,profound,silence,in,the,room,when,the,duke,again,addressed,themdo,you,not,remember,that,the,Duc,de,Guise,taught,all,the,dogs,in,Paris,to,jump,for,Mademoiselle,de,Pons,whom,he,styled,the,fairest,of,the,fair,Pistache,is,going,to,show,you,how,superior,he,is,to,all,other,dogs
Monsieur,de,Chavigny,be,so,good,as,to,lend,me,your,cane,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,handed,his,cane,to,Monsieur,de,Beaufort
Monsieur,de,Beaufort,placed,it,horizontally,at,the,height,of,one,foot
Now,Pistache,my,good,dog,jump,the,height,of,this,cane,for,Madame,de,Montbazon,But,interposed,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,it,seems,to,me,that,Pistache,is,only,doing,what,other,dogs,have,done,when,they,jumped,for,Mademoiselle,de,Pons,Stop,said,the,duke,Pistache,jump,for,the,queen,And,he,raised,his,cane,six,inches,higher
The,dog,sprang,and,in,spite,of,the,height,jumped,lightly,over,it
And,now,said,the,duke,raising,it,still,six,inches,higher,jump,for,the,king,The,dog,obeyed,and,jumped,quickly,over,the,cane
Now,then,said,the,duke,and,as,he,spoke,lowered,the,cane,almost,level,with,the,ground,Pistache,my,friend,jump,for,the,Illustrious,Coxcomb,Mazarin,de,Piscina,The,dog,turned,his,back,to,the,cane
What,asked,the,duke,what,do,you,mean,and,he,gave,him,the,cane,again,first,making,a,semicircle,from,the,head,to,the,tail,of,Pistache
Jump,then,Monsieur,Pistache,But,Pistache,as,at,first,turned,round,on,his,legs,and,stood,with,his,back,to,the,cane
Monsieur,de,Beaufort,made,the,experiment,a,third,time,but,by,this,time,Pistaches,patience,was,exhausted,he,threw,himself,furiously,upon,the,cane,wrested,it,from,the,hands,of,the,prince,and,broke,it,with,his,teeth
Monsieur,de,Beaufort,took,the,pieces,out,of,his,mouth,and,presented,them,with,great,formality,to,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,saying,that,for,that,evening,the,entertainment,was,ended,but,in,three,months,it,should,be,repeated,when,Pistache,would,have,learned,a,few,new,tricks
Three,days,afterward,Pistache,was,found,deadpoisoned
Then,the,duke,said,openly,that,his,dog,had,been,killed,by,a,drug,with,which,they,meant,to,poison,him,and,one,day,after,dinner,he,went,to,bed,calling,out,that,he,had,pains,in,his,stomach,and,that,Mazarin,had,poisoned,him
This,fresh,impertinence,reached,the,ears,of,the,cardinal,and,alarmed,him,greatly
The,donjon,of,Vincennes,was,considered,very,unhealthy,and,Madame,de,Rambouillet,had,said,that,the,room,in,which,the,Marechal,Ornano,and,the,Grand,Prior,de,Vendome,had,died,was,worth,its,weight,in,arsenica,bon,mot,which,had,great,success
So,it,was,ordered,the,prisoner,was,henceforth,to,eat,nothing,that,had,not,previously,been,tasted,and,La,Ramee,was,in,consequence,placed,near,him,as,taster
Every,kind,of,revenge,was,practiced,upon,the,duke,by,the,governor,in,return,for,the,insults,of,the,innocent,Pistache
De,Chavigny,who,according,to,report,was,a,son,of,Richelieus,and,had,been,a,creature,of,the,late,cardinals,understood,tyranny
He,took,from,the,duke,all,the,steel,knives,and,silver,forks,and,replaced,them,with,silver,knives,and,wooden,forks,pretending,that,as,he,had,been,informed,that,the,duke,was,to,pass,all,his,life,at,Vincennes,he,was,afraid,of,his,prisoner,attempting,suicide
A,fortnight,afterward,the,duke,going,to,the,tennis,court,found,two,rows,of,trees,about,the,size,of,his,little,finger,planted,by,the,roadside,he,asked,what,they,were,for,and,was,told,that,they,were,to,shade,him,from,the,sun,on,some,future,day
One,morning,the,gardener,went,to,him,and,told,him,as,if,to,please,him,that,he,was,going,to,plant,a,bed,of,asparagus,for,his,especial,use
Now,since,as,every,one,knows,asparagus,takes,four,years,in,coming,to,perfection,this,civility,infuriated,Monsieur,de,Beaufort
At,last,his,patience,was,exhausted
He,assembled,his,keepers,and,notwithstanding,his,wellknown,difficulty,of,utterance,addressed,them,as,follows,Gentlemen
will,you,permit,a,grandson,of,Henry,IV
to,be,overwhelmed,with,insults,and,ignominy
as,my,grandfather,used,to,say,I,once,reigned,in,Paris
I,had,the,king,and,Monsieur,the,whole,of,one,day,in,my,care
The,queen,at,that,time,liked,me,and,called,me,the,most,honest,man,in,the,kingdom
Gentlemen,and,citizens,set,me,free,I,shall,go,to,the,Louvre,and,strangle,Mazarin
I,will,make,you,all,captains,with,good,pensions
march,forward,But,eloquent,as,he,might,be,the,eloquence,of,the,grandson,of,Henry,IV
did,not,touch,those,hearts,of,stone,not,one,man,stirred,so,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,was,obliged,to,be,satisfied,with,calling,them,all,kinds,of,rascals,underneath,the,sun
Sometimes,when,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,paid,him,a,visit,the,duke,used,to,ask,him,what,he,should,think,if,he,saw,an,army,of,Parisians,all,fully,armed,appear,at,Vincennes,to,deliver,him,from,prison
My,lord,answered,De,Chavigny,with,a,low,bow,I,have,on,the,ramparts,twenty,pieces,of,artillery,and,in,my,casemates,thirty,thousand,guns
I,should,bombard,the,troops,till,not,one,grain,of,gunpowder,was,unexploded,Yes,but,after,you,had,fired,off,your,thirty,thousand,guns,they,would,take,the,donjon,the,donjon,being,taken,I,should,be,obliged,to,let,them,hang,youat,which,I,should,be,most,unhappy,certainly,And,in,his,turn,the,duke,bowed,low,to,Monsieur,de,Chavigny
For,myself,on,the,other,hand,my,lord,returned,the,governor,when,the,first,rebel,should,pass,the,threshold,of,my,postern,doors,I,should,be,obliged,to,kill,you,with,my,own,hand,since,you,were,confided,peculiarly,to,my,care,and,as,I,am,obliged,to,give,you,up,dead,or,alive,And,once,more,he,bowed,low,before,his,highness
These,bittersweet,pleasantries,lasted,ten,minutes,sometimes,longer,but,always,finished,thus,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,turning,toward,the,door,used,to,call,out,Halloo
La,Ramee,La,Ramee,came,into,the,room
La,Ramee,I,recommend,Monsieur,le,Duc,to,you,particularly,treat,him,as,a,man,of,his,rank,and,family,ought,to,be,treated,that,is,never,leave,him,alone,an,instant,La,Ramee,became,therefore,the,dukes,dinner,guest,by,compulsionan,eternal,keeper,the,shadow,of,his,person,but,La,Rameegay,frank,convivial,fond,of,play,a,great,hand,at,tennis,had,one,defect,in,the,dukes,eyeshis,incorruptibility
Now,although,La,Ramee,appreciated,as,of,a,certain,value,the,honor,of,being,shut,up,with,a,prisoner,of,so,great,importance,still,the,pleasure,of,living,in,intimacy,with,the,grandson,of,Henry,IV
hardly,compensated,for,the,loss,of,that,which,he,had,experienced,in,going,from,time,to,time,to,visit,his,family
One,may,be,a,jailer,or,a,keeper,and,at,the,same,time,a,good,father,and,husband
La,Ramee,adored,his,wife,and,children,whom,now,he,could,only,catch,a,glimpse,of,from,the,top,of,the,wall,when,in,order,to,please,him,they,used,to,walk,on,the,opposite,side,of,the,moat
Twas,too,brief,an,enjoyment,and,La,Ramee,felt,that,the,gayety,of,heart,he,had,regarded,as,the,cause,of,health,of,which,it,was,perhaps,rather,the,result,would,not,long,survive,such,a,mode,of,life
He,accepted,therefore,with,delight,an,offer,made,to,him,by,his,friend,the,steward,of,the,Duc,de,Grammont,to,give,him,a,substitute,he,also,spoke,of,it,to,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,who,promised,that,he,would,not,oppose,it,in,any,waythat,is,if,he,approved,of,the,person,proposed
We,consider,it,useless,to,draw,a,physical,or,moral,portrait,of,Grimaud,if,as,we,hope,our,readers,have,not,wholly,forgotten,the,first,part,of,this,work,they,must,have,preserved,a,clear,idea,of,that,estimable,individual,who,is,wholly,unchanged,except,that,he,is,twenty,years,older,an,advance,in,life,that,has,made,him,only,more,silent,although,since,the,change,that,had,been,working,in,himself,Athos,had,given,Grimaud,permission,to,speak
But,Grimaud,had,for,twelve,or,fifteen,years,preserved,habitual,silence,and,a,habit,of,fifteen,or,twenty,years,duration,becomes,second,nature
Grimaud,thereupon,presented,himself,with,his,smooth,exterior,at,the,donjon,of,Vincennes
Now,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,piqued,himself,on,his,infallible,penetration,for,that,which,almost,proved,that,he,was,the,son,of,Richelieu,was,his,everlasting,pretension,he,examined,attentively,the,countenance,of,the,applicant,for,place,and,fancied,that,the,contracted,eyebrows,thin,lips,hooked,nose,and,prominent,cheekbones,of,Grimaud,were,favorable,signs
He,addressed,about,twelve,words,to,him,Grimaud,answered,in,four
Heres,a,promising,fellow,and,it,is,I,who,have,found,out,his,merits,said,Monsieur,de,Chavigny
Go,he,added,and,make,yourself,agreeable,to,Monsieur,la,Ramee,and,tell,him,that,you,suit,me,in,all,respects,Grimaud,had,every,quality,that,could,attract,a,man,on,duty,who,wishes,to,have,a,deputy
So,after,a,thousand,questions,which,met,with,only,a,word,in,reply,La,Ramee,fascinated,by,this,sobriety,in,speech,rubbed,his,hands,and,engaged,Grimaud
They,are,these,never,to,leave,the,prisoner,alone,to,keep,away,from,him,every,pointed,or,cutting,instrument,and,to,prevent,his,conversing,any,length,of,time,with,the,keepers,Those,are,all,asked,Grimaud
Good,answered,Grimaud,and,he,went,right,to,the,prisoner
The,duke,was,in,the,act,of,combing,his,beard,which,he,had,allowed,to,grow,as,well,as,his,hair,in,order,to,reproach,Mazarin,with,his,wretched,appearance,and,condition
But,having,some,days,previously,seen,from,the,top,of,the,donjon,Madame,de,Montbazon,pass,in,her,carriage,and,still,cherishing,an,affection,for,that,beautiful,woman,he,did,not,wish,to,be,to,her,what,he,wished,to,be,to,Mazarin,and,in,the,hope,of,seeing,her,again,had,asked,for,a,leaden,comb,which,was,allowed,him
The,comb,was,to,be,a,leaden,one,because,his,beard,like,that,of,most,fair,people,was,rather,red,he,therefore,dyed,it,thus,whilst,combing,it
As,Grimaud,entered,he,saw,this,comb,on,the,teatable,he,took,it,up,and,as,he,took,it,he,made,a,low,bow
The,duke,looked,at,this,strange,figure,with,surprise
The,figure,put,the,comb,in,its,pocket
Who,is,this,creature,Grimaud,did,not,answer,but,bowed,a,second,time
Art,thou,dumb,cried,the,duke
Grimaud,made,a,sign,that,he,was,not
I,command,thee,said,the,duke
A,keeper,reiterated,the,duke,there,was,nothing,wanting,in,my,collection,except,this,gallowsbird
some,one,La,Ramee,ran,in,haste,to,obey,the,call
Who,is,this,wretch,who,takes,my,comb,and,puts,it,in,his,pocket,asked,the,duke
One,of,your,guards,my,prince,a,man,of,talent,and,merit,whom,you,will,like,as,I,and,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,do,I,am,sure,Why,does,he,take,my,comb,Why,do,you,take,my,lords,comb,asked,La,Ramee
Grimaud,drew,the,comb,from,his,pocket,and,passing,his,fingers,over,the,largest,teeth,pronounced,this,one,word,Pointed,True,said,La,Ramee
What,does,the,animal,say,asked,the,duke
That,the,king,has,forbidden,your,lordship,to,have,any,pointed,instrument,Are,you,mad,La,Ramee
You,yourself,gave,me,this,comb,I,was,very,wrong,my,lord,for,in,giving,it,to,you,I,acted,in,opposition,to,my,orders,The,duke,looked,furiously,at,Grimaud
I,perceive,that,this,creature,will,be,my,particular,aversion,he,muttered
Grimaud,nevertheless,was,resolved,for,certain,reasons,not,at,once,to,come,to,a,full,rupture,with,the,prisoner,he,wanted,to,inspire,not,a,sudden,repugnance,but,a,good,sound,steady,hatred,he,retired,therefore,and,gave,place,to,four,guards,who,having,breakfasted,could,attend,on,the,prisoner
A,fresh,practical,joke,now,occurred,to,the,duke
He,had,asked,for,crawfish,for,his,breakfast,on,the,following,morning,he,intended,to,pass,the,day,in,making,a,small,gallows,and,hang,one,of,the,finest,of,these,fish,in,the,middle,of,his,roomthe,red,color,evidently,conveying,an,allusion,to,the,cardinalso,that,he,might,have,the,pleasure,of,hanging,Mazarin,in,effigy,without,being,accused,of,having,hung,anything,more,significant,than,a,crawfish
The,day,was,employed,in,preparations,for,the,execution
Every,one,grows,childish,in,prison,but,the,character,of,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,was,particularly,disposed,to,become,so
In,the,course,of,his,mornings,walk,he,collected,two,or,three,small,branches,from,a,tree,and,found,a,small,piece,of,broken,glass,a,discovery,that,quite,delighted,him
When,he,came,home,he,formed,his,handkerchief,into,a,loop
Nothing,of,all,this,escaped,Grimaud,but,La,Ramee,looked,on,with,the,curiosity,of,a,father,who,thinks,that,he,may,perhaps,get,a,cheap,idea,concerning,a,new,toy,for,his,children
The,guards,looked,on,it,with,indifference
When,everything,was,ready,the,gallows,hung,in,the,middle,of,the,room,the,loop,made,and,when,the,duke,had,cast,a,glance,upon,the,plate,of,crawfish,in,order,to,select,the,finest,specimen,among,them,he,looked,around,for,his,piece,of,glass,it,had,disappeared
Who,has,taken,my,piece,of,glass,asked,the,duke,frowning
Grimaud,made,a,sign,to,denote,that,he,had,done,so
Why,didst,thou,take,it,Yeswhy,asked,La,Ramee
Grimaud,who,held,the,piece,of,glass,in,his,hand,said,Sharp,True,my,lord,exclaimed,La,Ramee
we,have,a,precious,fellow,here,Monsieur,Grimaud,said,the,duke,for,your,sake,I,beg,of,you,never,come,within,the,reach,of,my,fist,Hush
hush,cried,La,Ramee,give,me,your,gibbet,my,lord
I,will,shape,it,out,for,you,with,my,knife,And,he,took,the,gibbet,and,shaped,it,out,as,neatly,as,possible
Thats,it,said,the,duke,now,make,me,a,little,hole,in,the,floor,whilst,I,go,and,fetch,the,culprit,La,Ramee,knelt,down,and,made,a,hole,in,the,floor,meanwhile,the,duke,hung,the,crawfish,up,by,a,thread
Then,he,placed,the,gibbet,in,the,middle,of,the,room,bursting,with,laughter
La,Ramee,laughed,also,and,the,guards,laughed,in,chorus,Grimaud,however,did,not,even,smile
He,approached,La,Ramee,and,showing,him,the,crawfish,hung,up,by,the,thread,Cardinal,he,said
Hung,by,order,of,his,Highness,the,Duc,de,Beaufort,cried,the,prisoner,laughing,violently,and,by,Master,Jacques,Chrysostom,La,Ramee,the,kings,commissioner,La,Ramee,uttered,a,cry,of,horror,and,rushed,toward,the,gibbet,which,he,broke,at,once,and,threw,the,pieces,out,of,the,window
He,was,going,to,throw,the,crawfish,out,also,when,Grimaud,snatched,it,from,his,hands
Good,to,eat,he,said,and,put,it,in,his,pocket
This,scene,so,enchanted,the,duke,that,at,the,moment,he,forgave,Grimaud,for,his,part,in,it,but,on,reflection,he,hated,him,more,and,more,being,convinced,he,had,some,evil,motive,for,his,conduct
But,the,story,of,the,crab,made,a,great,noise,through,the,interior,of,the,donjon,and,even,outside
Monsieur,de,Chavigny,who,at,heart,detested,the,cardinal,took,pains,to,tell,the,story,to,two,or,three,friends,who,put,it,into,immediate,circulation
The,prisoner,happened,to,remark,among,the,guards,one,man,with,a,very,good,countenance,and,he,favored,this,man,the,more,as,Grimaud,became,the,more,and,more,odious,to,him
One,morning,he,took,this,man,on,one,side,and,had,succeeded,in,speaking,to,him,when,Grimaud,entered,and,seeing,what,was,going,on,approached,the,duke,respectfully,but,took,the,guard,by,the,arm
You,are,insupportable,cried,the,duke,I,shall,beat,you,Grimaud,bowed
I,will,break,every,bone,in,your,body,cried,the,duke
Spy,cried,the,duke,more,and,more,enraged,I,will,strangle,you,with,my,own,hands,And,he,extended,his,hands,toward,Grimaud,who,merely,thrust,the,guard,out,and,shut,the,door,behind,him
At,the,same,time,he,felt,the,dukes,arms,on,his,shoulders,like,two,iron,claws,but,instead,either,of,calling,out,or,defending,himself,he,placed,his,forefinger,on,his,lips,and,said,in,a,low,tone,Hush,smiling,as,he,uttered,the,word
A,gesture,a,smile,and,a,word,from,Grimaud,all,at,once,were,so,unusual,that,his,highness,stopped,short,astounded
Grimaud,took,advantage,of,that,instant,to,draw,from,his,vest,a,charming,little,note,with,an,aristocratic,seal,and,presented,it,to,the,duke,without,a,word
The,duke,more,and,more,bewildered,let,Grimaud,loose,and,took,the,note
From,Madame,de,Montbazon,he,cried
The,duke,tore,open,the,note,passed,his,hands,over,his,eyes,for,he,was,dazzled,and,confused,and,read,My,Dear,DukeYou,may,entirely,confide,in,the,brave,lad,who,will,give,you,this,note,he,has,consented,to,enter,the,service,of,your,keeper,and,to,shut,himself,up,at,Vincennes,with,you,in,order,to,prepare,and,assist,your,escape,which,we,are,contriving
The,moment,of,your,deliverance,is,at,hand,have,patience,and,courage,and,remember,that,in,spite,of,time,and,absence,all,your,friends,continue,to,cherish,for,you,the,sentiments,they,have,so,long,professed,and,truly,entertained
Yours,wholly,and,most,affectionately,Marie,de,Montbazon
PSI,sign,my,full,name,for,I,should,be,vain,if,I,could,suppose,that,after,five,years,of,absence,you,would,remember,my,initials,The,poor,duke,became,perfectly,giddy
What,for,five,years,he,had,been,wantinga,faithful,servant,a,friend,a,helping,handseemed,to,have,fallen,from,Heaven,just,when,he,expected,it,the,least
she,thinks,of,me,then,after,five,years,of,separation
there,is,constancy,Then,turning,to,Grimaud,he,said,And,thou,my,brave,fellow,thou,consentest,thus,to,aid,me,Grimaud,signified,his,assent
And,you,have,come,here,with,that,purpose,Grimaud,repeated,the,sign
And,I,was,ready,to,strangle,you,cried,the,duke
Wait,then,said,the,duke,fumbling,in,his,pocket
Wait,he,continued,renewing,his,fruitless,search,it,shall,not,be,said,that,such,devotion,to,a,grandson,of,Henry,IV
went,without,recompense,The,dukes,endeavors,evinced,the,best,intention,in,the,world,but,one,of,the,precautions,taken,at,Vincennes,was,that,of,allowing,prisoners,to,keep,no,money
Whereupon,Grimaud,observing,the,dukes,disappointment,drew,from,his,pocket,a,purse,filled,with,gold,and,handed,it,to,him
Here,is,what,you,are,looking,for,he,said
The,duke,opened,the,purse,and,wanted,to,empty,it,into,Grimauds,hands,but,Grimaud,shook,his,head
Thank,you,monseigneur,he,said,drawing,back,I,am,paid,The,duke,went,from,one,surprise,to,another
Grimaud,drew,near,and,kissed,it,respectfully
The,grand,manner,of,Athos,had,left,its,mark,on,Grimaud
and,how,proceed,It,is,now,eleven,answered,Grimaud
Let,my,lord,at,two,oclock,ask,leave,to,make,up,a,game,at,tennis,with,La,Ramee,and,let,him,send,two,or,three,balls,over,the,ramparts,And,then,Your,highness,will,approach,the,walls,and,call,out,to,a,man,who,works,in,the,moat,to,send,them,back,again,I,understand,said,the,duke
Grimaud,made,a,sign,that,he,was,going,away
Ah,cried,the,duke,will,you,not,accept,any,money,from,me,I,wish,my,lord,would,make,me,one,promise,What
speak,Tis,this,when,we,escape,together,that,I,shall,go,everywhere,and,be,always,first,for,if,my,lord,should,be,overtaken,and,caught,theres,every,chance,of,his,being,brought,back,to,prison,whereas,if,I,am,caught,the,least,that,can,befall,me,is,to,behung,True,on,my,honor,as,a,gentleman,it,shall,be,as,thou,dost,suggest,Now,resumed,Grimaud,Ive,only,one,thing,more,to,askthat,your,highness,will,continue,to,detest,me,Ill,try,said,the,duke
At,this,moment,La,Ramee,after,the,interview,we,have,described,with,the,cardinal,entered,the,room
The,duke,had,thrown,himself,as,he,was,wont,to,do,in,moments,of,dullness,and,vexation,on,his,bed
La,Ramee,cast,an,inquiring,look,around,him,and,observing,the,same,signs,of,antipathy,between,the,prisoner,and,his,guardian,he,smiled,in,token,of,his,inward,satisfaction
Then,turning,to,Grimaud,Very,good,my,friend,very,good
You,have,been,spoken,of,in,a,promising,quarter,and,you,will,soon,I,hope,have,news,that,will,be,agreeable,to,you,Grimaud,saluted,in,his,politest,manner,and,withdrew,as,was,his,custom,on,the,entrance,of,his,superior

I,threw,myself,on,the,bed,and,turned,my,nose,to,the,wall,that,I,mightnt,break,my,promise,and,strangle,Grimaud,I,doubt,however,said,La,Ramee,in,sprightly,allusion,to,the,silence,of,his,subordinate,if,he,has,said,anything,disagreeable,to,your,highness,Pardieu
you,are,righta,mute,from,the,East
I,swear,it,was,time,for,you,to,come,back,La,Ramee,and,I,was,eager,to,see,you,again,Monseigneur,is,too,good,said,La,Ramee,flattered,by,the,compliment

If,you,wish,it,I,am,at,your,service,my,lord,I,protest,my,dear,La,Ramee,said,the,duke,that,you,are,a,charming,fellow,and,that,I,would,stay,forever,at,Vincennes,to,have,the,pleasure,of,your,society,My,lord,replied,La,Ramee,I,think,if,it,depended,on,the,cardinal,your,wishes,would,be,fulfilled,What,do,you,mean
Have,you,seen,him,lately,He,sent,for,me,today,Really

I,cannot,hear,such,things,said,as,that,this,is,a,fine,conversation,with,an,officer,of,the,king
I,see,my,lord,I,shall,be,obliged,to,fetch,a,second,Grimaud,Very,well,let,us,say,no,more,about,it
So,you,and,the,cardinal,have,been,talking,about,me
La,Ramee,some,day,when,he,sends,for,you,you,must,let,me,put,on,your,clothes,I,will,go,in,your,stead,I,will,strangle,him,and,upon,my,honor,if,that,is,made,a,condition,I,will,return,to,prison,Monseigneur,I,see,well,that,I,must,call,Grimaud,Well,I,am,wrong
And,what,did,the,cuistre,pettifogger,say,about,me,I,admit,the,word,monseigneur,because,it,rhymes,with,ministre,minister
What,did,he,say,to,me
He,told,me,to,watch,you,And,why,so
why,watch,me,asked,the,duke,uneasily
Because,an,astrologer,had,predicted,that,you,would,escape,Ah
an,astrologer,predicted,that,said,the,duke,starting,in,spite,of,himself
those,imbeciles,of,magicians,can,only,imagine,things,to,torment,honest,people,And,what,did,you,reply,to,his,most,illustrious,eminence,That,if,the,astrologer,in,question,made,almanacs,I,would,advise,him,not,to,buy,one,Why,not,Because,before,you,could,escape,you,would,have,to,be,turned,into,a,bird,Unfortunately,that,is,true
Let,us,go,and,have,a,game,at,tennis,La,Ramee,My,lordI,beg,your,highnesss,pardonbut,I,must,beg,for,half,an,hours,leave,of,absence,Why,Because,Monseigneur,Mazarin,is,a,prouder,man,than,his,highness,though,not,of,such,high,birth,he,forgot,to,ask,me,to,breakfast,Well,shall,I,send,for,some,breakfast,here,No,my,lord,I,must,tell,you,that,the,confectioner,who,lived,opposite,the,castleDaddy,Marteau,as,they,called,him,Well,Well,he,sold,his,business,a,week,ago,to,a,confectioner,from,Paris,an,invalid,ordered,country,air,for,his,health,Well,what,have,I,to,do,with,that,Why,good,Lord
this,man,your,highness,when,he,saw,me,stop,before,his,shop,where,he,has,a,display,of,things,which,would,make,your,mouth,water,my,lord,asked,me,to,get,him,the,custom,of,the,prisoners,in,the,donjon
I,bought,said,he,the,business,of,my,predecessor,on,the,strength,of,his,assurance,that,he,supplied,the,castle,whereas,on,my,honor,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,though,Ive,been,here,a,week,has,not,ordered,so,much,as,a,tartlet,But,I,then,replied,probably,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,is,afraid,your,pastry,is,not,good,My,pastry,not,good
Well,Monsieur,La,Ramee,you,shall,judge,of,it,yourself,and,at,once,I,cannot,I,replied,it,is,absolutely,necessary,for,me,to,return,to,the,chateau,Very,well,said,he,go,and,attend,to,your,affairs,since,you,seem,to,be,in,a,hurry,but,come,back,in,half,an,hour,In,half,an,hour,Yes,have,you,breakfasted,Faith,no,Well,here,is,a,pate,that,will,be,ready,for,you,with,a,bottle,of,old,Burgundy,So,you,see,my,lord,since,I,am,hungry,I,would,with,your,highnesss,leave,And,La,Ramee,bent,low
Go,then,animal,said,the,duke,but,remember,I,only,allow,you,half,an,hour,May,I,promise,your,custom,to,the,successor,of,Father,Marteau,my,lord,Yes,if,he,does,not,put,mushrooms,in,his,pies,thou,knowest,that,mushrooms,from,the,wood,of,Vincennes,are,fatal,to,my,family,La,Ramee,went,out,but,in,five,minutes,one,of,the,officers,of,the,guard,entered,in,compliance,with,the,strict,orders,of,the,cardinal,that,the,prisoner,should,never,be,left,alone,a,moment
But,during,these,five,minutes,the,duke,had,had,time,to,read,again,the,note,from,Madame,de,Montbazon,which,proved,to,the,prisoner,that,his,friends,were,concerting,plans,for,his,deliverance,but,in,what,way,he,knew,not
But,his,confidence,in,Grimaud,whose,petty,persecutions,he,now,perceived,were,only,a,blind,increased,and,he,conceived,the,highest,opinion,of,his,intellect,and,resolved,to,trust,entirely,to,his,guidance
Pâtés,made,by,the,Successor,of,Father,Marteau,are,described
In,half,an,hour,La,Ramee,returned,full,of,glee,like,most,men,who,have,eaten,and,more,especially,drank,to,their,hearts,content
The,pates,were,excellent,the,wine,delicious
The,weather,was,fine,and,the,game,at,tennis,took,place,in,the,open,air
At,two,oclock,the,tennis,balls,began,according,to,Grimauds,directions,to,take,the,direction,of,the,moat,much,to,the,joy,of,La,Ramee,who,marked,fifteen,whenever,the,duke,sent,a,ball,into,the,moat,and,very,soon,balls,were,wanting,so,many,had,gone,over
La,Ramee,then,proposed,to,send,some,one,to,pick,them,up,but,the,duke,remarked,that,it,would,be,losing,time,and,going,near,the,rampart,himself,and,looking,over,he,saw,a,man,working,in,one,of,the,numerous,little,gardens,cleared,out,by,the,peasants,on,the,opposite,side,of,the,moat
The,man,raised,his,head,and,the,duke,was,about,to,utter,a,cry,of,surprise
The,peasant,the,gardener,was,Rochefort,whom,he,believed,to,be,in,the,Bastile
Whos,up,there,said,the,man
Be,so,good,as,to,collect,and,throw,us,back,our,balls,said,the,duke
The,gardener,nodded,and,began,to,fling,up,the,balls,which,were,picked,up,by,La,Ramee,and,the,guard
One,however,fell,at,the,dukes,feet,and,seeing,that,it,was,intended,for,him,he,put,it,into,his,pocket
La,Ramee,was,in,ecstasies,at,having,beaten,a,prince,of,the,blood
The,duke,went,indoors,and,retired,to,bed,where,he,spent,indeed,the,greater,part,of,every,day,as,they,had,taken,his,books,away
La,Ramee,carried,off,all,his,clothes,in,order,to,be,certain,that,the,duke,would,not,stir
However,the,duke,contrived,to,hide,the,ball,under,his,bolster,and,as,soon,as,the,door,was,closed,he,tore,off,the,cover,of,the,ball,with,his,teeth,and,found,underneath,the,following,letter,My,LordYour,friends,are,watching,over,you,and,the,hour,of,your,deliverance,is,at,hand
Ask,day,after,tomorrow,to,have,a,pie,supplied,you,by,the,new,confectioner,opposite,the,castle,and,who,is,no,other,than,Noirmont,your,former,maitre,dhotel
Do,not,open,the,pie,till,you,are,alone
I,hope,you,will,be,satisfied,with,its,contents
Your,highnesss,most,devoted,servant,In,the,Bastile,as,elsewhere,Comte,de,Rochefort,The,duke,who,had,latterly,been,allowed,a,fire,burned,the,letter,but,kept,the,ball,and,went,to,bed,hiding,the,ball,under,his,bolster
La,Ramee,entered,he,smiled,kindly,on,the,prisoner,for,he,was,an,excellent,man,and,had,taken,a,great,liking,for,the,captive,prince
He,endeavored,to,cheer,him,up,in,his,solitude
Ah,my,friend,cried,the,duke,you,are,so,good,if,I,could,but,do,as,you,do,and,eat,pates,and,drink,Burgundy,at,the,house,of,Father,Marteaus,successor,Tis,true,my,lord,answered,La,Ramee,that,his,pates,are,famous,and,his,wine,magnificent,In,any,case,said,the,duke,his,cellar,and,kitchen,might,easily,excel,those,of,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,Well,my,lord,said,La,Ramee,falling,into,the,trap,what,is,there,to,prevent,your,trying,them
Besides,I,have,promised,him,your,patronage,You,are,right,said,the,duke
If,I,am,to,remain,here,permanently,as,Monsieur,Mazarin,has,kindly,given,me,to,understand,I,must,provide,myself,with,a,diversion,for,my,old,age,I,must,turn,gourmand,My,lord,said,La,Ramee,if,you,will,take,a,bit,of,good,advice,dont,put,that,off,till,you,are,old,Good,said,the,Duc,de,Beaufort,to,himself,every,man,in,order,that,he,may,lose,his,heart,and,soul,must,receive,from,celestial,bounty,one,of,the,seven,capital,sins,perhaps,two,it,seems,that,Master,La,Ramees,is,gluttony
Let,us,then,take,advantage,of,it,Then,aloud,Well,my,dear,La,Ramee
the,day,after,tomorrow,is,a,holiday,Yes,my,lordPentecost,Will,you,give,me,a,lesson,the,day,after,tomorrow,In,what,In,gastronomy,Willingly,my,lord,But,teteatete
Send,the,guards,to,take,their,meal,in,the,canteen,of,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,well,have,a,supper,here,under,your,direction,Hum,said,La,Ramee
The,proposal,was,seductive,but,La,Ramee,was,an,old,stager,acquainted,with,all,the,traps,a,prisoner,was,likely,to,set
Monsieur,de,Beaufort,had,said,that,he,had,forty,ways,of,getting,out,of,prison
Did,this,proposed,breakfast,cover,some,stratagem
He,reflected,but,he,remembered,that,he,himself,would,have,charge,of,the,food,and,the,wine,and,therefore,that,no,powder,could,be,mixed,with,the,food,no,drug,with,the,wine
As,to,getting,him,drunk,the,duke,couldnt,hope,to,do,that,and,he,laughed,at,the,mere,thought,of,it
Then,an,idea,came,to,him,which,harmonized,everything
The,duke,had,followed,with,anxiety,La,Ramees,unspoken,soliloquy,reading,it,from,point,to,point,upon,his,face
But,presently,the,exempts,face,suddenly,brightened
Well,he,asked,that,will,do,will,it,not,Yes,my,lord,on,one,condition,What,That,Grimaud,shall,wait,on,us,at,table,Nothing,could,be,more,agreeable,to,the,duke,however,he,had,presence,of,mind,enough,to,exclaim,To,the,devil,with,your,Grimaud
He,will,spoil,the,feast,I,will,direct,him,to,stand,behind,your,chair,and,since,he,doesnt,speak,your,highness,will,neither,see,nor,hear,him,and,with,a,little,effort,can,imagine,him,a,hundred,miles,away,Do,you,know,my,friend,I,find,one,thing,very,evident,in,all,this,you,distrust,me,My,lord,the,day,after,tomorrow,is,Pentecost,Well,what,is,Pentecost,to,me
Are,you,afraid,that,the,Holy,Spirit,will,come,as,a,tongue,of,fire,to,open,the,doors,of,my,prison,No,my,lord,but,I,have,already,told,you,what,that,damned,magician,predicted,And,what,was,it,That,the,day,of,Pentecost,would,not,pass,without,your,highness,being,out,of,Vincennes,You,believe,in,sorcerers,then,you,fool,II,mind,them,no,more,than,that,and,he,snapped,his,fingers,but,it,is,my,Lord,Giulio,who,cares,about,them,as,an,Italian,he,is,superstitious,The,duke,shrugged,his,shoulders
Well,then,with,well,acted,goodhumor,I,allow,Grimaud,but,no,one,else,you,must,manage,it,all
Order,whatever,you,like,for,supperthe,only,thing,I,specify,is,one,of,those,pies,and,tell,the,confectioner,that,I,will,promise,him,my,custom,if,he,excels,this,time,in,his,piesnot,only,now,but,when,I,leave,my,prison,Then,you,think,you,will,some,day,leave,it,said,La,Ramee
The,devil,replied,the,prince,surely,at,the,death,of,Mazarin
I,am,fifteen,years,younger,than,he,is
At,Vincennes,tis,true,one,lives,faster,My,lord,replied,La,Ramee,my,lord,Or,dies,sooner,for,it,comes,to,the,same,thing,La,Ramee,was,going,out
He,stopped,however,at,the,door,for,an,instant
Whom,does,your,highness,wish,me,to,send,to,you,Any,one,except,Grimaud,The,officer,of,the,guard,then,with,his,chessboard,Yes,Five,minutes,afterward,the,officer,entered,and,the,duke,seemed,to,be,immersed,in,the,sublime,combinations,of,chess
A,strange,thing,is,the,mind,and,it,is,wonderful,what,revolutions,may,be,wrought,in,it,by,a,sign,a,word,a,hope
The,duke,had,been,five,years,in,prison,and,now,to,him,looking,back,upon,them,those,five,years,which,had,passed,so,slowly,seemed,not,so,long,a,time,as,were,the,two,days,the,fortyeight,hours,which,still,parted,him,from,the,time,fixed,for,his,escape
Besides,there,was,one,thing,that,engaged,his,most,anxious,thoughtin,what,way,was,the,escape,to,be,effected
They,had,told,him,to,hope,for,it,but,had,not,told,him,what,was,to,be,hidden,in,the,mysterious,pate
And,what,friends,awaited,him,without
He,had,friends,then,after,five,years,in,prison
If,that,were,so,he,was,indeed,a,highly,favored,prince
He,forgot,that,besides,his,friends,of,his,own,sex,a,woman,strange,to,say,had,remembered,him
It,is,true,that,she,had,not,perhaps,been,scrupulously,faithful,to,him,but,she,had,remembered,him,that,was,something
So,the,duke,had,more,than,enough,to,think,about,accordingly,he,fared,at,chess,as,he,had,fared,at,tennis,he,made,blunder,upon,blunder,and,the,officer,with,whom,he,played,found,him,easy,game
But,his,successive,defeats,did,service,to,the,duke,in,one,waythey,killed,time,for,him,till,eight,oclock,in,the,evening,then,would,come,night,and,with,night,sleep
So,at,least,the,duke,believed,but,sleep,is,a,capricious,fairy,and,it,is,precisely,when,one,invokes,her,presence,that,she,is,most,likely,to,keep,him,waiting
The,duke,waited,until,midnight,turning,on,his,mattress,like,St,Laurence,on,his,gridiron
Wild,dreams,had,disturbed,his,repose
He,dreamed,that,he,was,endowed,with,wingshe,wished,to,fly,away
For,a,time,these,wings,supported,him,but,when,he,reached,a,certain,height,this,new,aid,failed,him
His,wings,were,broken,and,he,seemed,to,sink,into,a,bottomless,abyss,whence,he,awoke,bathed,in,perspiration,and,nearly,as,much,overcome,as,if,he,had,really,fallen
He,fell,asleep,again,and,another,vision,appeared
He,was,in,a,subterranean,passage,by,which,he,was,to,leave,Vincennes
Grimaud,was,walking,before,him,with,a,lantern
By,degrees,the,passage,narrowed,yet,the,duke,continued,his,course
At,last,it,became,so,narrow,that,the,fugitive,tried,in,vain,to,proceed
The,sides,of,the,walls,seem,to,close,in,even,to,press,against,him
He,made,fruitless,efforts,to,go,on,it,was,impossible
Nevertheless,he,still,saw,Grimaud,with,his,lantern,in,front,advancing
He,wished,to,call,out,to,him,but,could,not,utter,a,word
Then,at,the,other,extremity,he,heard,the,footsteps,of,those,who,were,pursuing,him
These,steps,came,on,came,fast
He,was,discovered,all,hope,of,flight,was,gone
Still,the,walls,seemed,to,be,closing,on,him,they,appeared,to,be,in,concert,with,his,enemies
At,last,he,heard,the,voice,of,La,Ramee
La,Ramee,took,his,hand,and,laughed,aloud
He,was,captured,again,and,conducted,to,the,low,and,vaulted,chamber,in,which,Ornano,Puylaurens,and,his,uncle,had,died
Their,three,graves,were,there,rising,above,the,ground,and,a,fourth,was,also,there,yawning,for,its,ghastly,tenant
The,duke,was,obliged,to,make,as,many,efforts,to,awake,as,he,had,done,to,go,to,sleep,and,La,Ramee,found,him,so,pale,and,fatigued,that,he,inquired,whether,he,was,ill,In,fact,said,one,of,the,guards,who,had,remained,in,the,chamber,and,had,been,kept,awake,by,a,toothache,brought,on,by,the,dampness,of,the,atmosphere,my,lord,has,had,a,very,restless,night,and,two,or,three,times,while,dreaming,he,called,for,help,What,is,the,matter,with,your,highness,asked,La,Ramee
Tis,your,fault,you,simpleton,answered,the,duke
With,your,idle,nonsense,yesterday,about,escaping,you,worried,me,so,that,I,dreamed,that,I,was,trying,to,escape,and,broke,my,neck,in,doing,so,La,Ramee,laughed
Come,he,said,tis,a,warning,from,Heaven
Never,commit,such,an,imprudence,as,to,try,to,escape,except,in,your,dreams,And,you,are,right,my,dear,La,Ramee,said,the,duke,wiping,away,the,sweat,that,stood,on,his,brow,wide,awake,though,he,was,after,this,I,will,think,of,nothing,but,eating,and,drinking,Hush,said,La,Ramee,and,one,by,one,he,sent,away,the,guards,on,various,pretexts
Well,asked,the,duke,when,they,were,alone
Well,replied,La,Ramee,your,supper,is,ordered,Ah

La,Ramee,drew,near,to,Grimaud,who,spoke,to,him,in,a,low,voice
The,duke,meanwhile,recovered,his,selfcontrol
I,have,already,forbidden,that,man,he,said,to,come,in,here,without,my,permission,You,must,pardon,him,my,lord,said,La,Ramee,for,I,directed,him,to,come,And,why,did,you,so,direct,when,you,know,that,he,displeases,me,My,lord,will,remember,that,it,was,agreed,between,us,that,he,should,wait,upon,us,at,that,famous,supper

And,now,said,La,Ramee,I,must,ask,your,highnesss,pardon,but,it,seems,that,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,is,to,be,away,for,a,few,days,and,he,has,sent,me,word,that,he,has,certain,directions,to,give,me,before,his,departure,The,duke,tried,to,exchange,a,glance,with,Grimaud,but,there,was,no,glance,in,Grimauds,eyes
Go,then,said,the,duke,and,return,as,soon,as,possible,Does,your,highness,wish,to,take,revenge,for,the,game,of,tennis,yesterday,Grimaud,intimated,by,a,scarcely,perceptible,nod,that,he,should,consent

Grimaud,looked,after,him,and,when,the,door,was,closed,he,drew,out,of,his,pocket,a,pencil,and,a,sheet,of,paper

Yes,I,understand,My,lord,observes,that,there,will,be,enough,to,go,around,We,shall,take,to,ourselves,the,poniards,and,the,rope,replied,the,duke

My,dear,Grimaud,thou,speakest,seldom,but,when,thou,dost,one,must,do,thee,justicethy,words,are,words,of,gold,One,of,Marie,Michons,Adventures
Whilst,these,projects,were,being,formed,by,the,Duc,de,Beaufort,and,Grimaud,the,Comte,de,la,Fere,and,the,Vicomte,de,Bragelonne,were,entering,Paris,by,the,Rue,du,Faubourg,Saint,Marcel
They,stopped,at,the,sign,of,the,Fox,in,the,Rue,du,Vieux,Colombier,a,tavern,known,for,many,years,by,Athos,and,asked,for,two,bedrooms
You,must,dress,yourself,Raoul,said,Athos,I,am,going,to,present,you,to,some,one,Today,monsieur,asked,the,young,man
In,half,an,hour,The,young,man,bowed
Perhaps,not,being,endowed,with,the,endurance,of,Athos,who,seemed,to,be,made,of,iron,he,would,have,preferred,a,bath,in,the,river,Seine,of,which,he,had,heard,so,much,and,afterward,his,bed,but,the,Comte,de,la,Fere,had,spoken,and,he,had,no,thought,but,to,obey
By,the,way,said,Athos,take,some,pains,with,your,toilet,Raoul,I,want,you,to,be,approved,I,hope,sir,replied,the,youth,smiling,that,theres,no,idea,of,a,marriage,for,me,you,know,of,my,engagement,to,Louise,Athos,in,his,turn,smiled,also
No,dont,be,alarmed,although,it,is,to,a,lady,that,I,am,going,to,present,you,and,I,am,anxious,that,you,should,love,her,The,young,man,looked,at,the,count,with,a,certain,uneasiness,but,at,a,smile,from,Athos,he,was,quickly,reassured
How,old,is,she,inquired,the,Vicomte,de,Bragelonne
My,dear,Raoul,learn,once,for,all,that,that,is,a,question,which,is,never,asked
When,you,can,find,out,a,womans,age,by,her,face,it,is,useless,to,ask,it,when,you,cannot,do,so,it,is,indiscreet,Is,she,beautiful,Sixteen,years,ago,she,was,deemed,not,only,the,prettiest,but,the,most,graceful,woman,in,France,This,reply,reassured,the,vicomte
A,woman,who,had,been,a,reigning,beauty,a,year,before,he,was,born,could,not,be,the,subject,of,any,scheme,for,him
When,he,reappeared,Athos,received,him,with,the,same,paternal,smile,as,that,which,he,had,often,bestowed,on,DArtagnan,but,a,more,profound,tenderness,for,Raoul,was,now,visibly,impressed,upon,his,face
Athos,cast,a,glance,at,his,feet,hands,and,hairthose,three,marks,of,race
The,youths,dark,hair,was,neatly,parted,and,hung,in,curls,forming,a,sort,of,dark,frame,around,his,face,such,was,the,fashion,of,the,day
Gloves,of,gray,kid,matching,the,hat,well,displayed,the,form,of,a,slender,and,elegant,hand,whilst,his,boots,similar,in,color,to,the,hat,and,gloves,confined,feet,small,as,those,of,a,boy,twelve,years,old
Come,murmured,Athos,if,she,is,not,proud,of,him,she,must,be,hard,to,please,It,was,three,oclock,in,the,afternoon
The,two,travelers,proceeded,to,the,Rue,Saint,Dominique,and,stopped,at,the,door,of,a,magnificent,hotel,surmounted,with,the,arms,of,De,Luynes
He,entered,the,hotel,and,ascended,the,front,steps,and,addressing,a,footman,who,waited,there,in,a,grand,livery,asked,if,the,Duchess,de,Chevreuse,was,visible,and,if,she,could,receive,the,Comte,de,la,Fere
The,servant,returned,with,a,message,to,say,that,though,the,duchess,had,not,the,honor,of,knowing,Monsieur,de,la,Fere,she,would,receive,him
Athos,followed,the,footman,who,led,him,through,a,long,succession,of,apartments,and,paused,at,length,before,a,closed,door
Athos,made,a,sign,to,the,Vicomte,de,Bragelonne,to,remain,where,he,was
The,footman,opened,the,door,and,announced,Monsieur,le,Comte,de,la,Fere
Madame,de,Chevreuse,whose,name,appears,so,often,in,our,story,The,Three,Musketeers,without,her,actually,having,appeared,in,any,scene,was,still,a,beautiful,woman
Although,about,fortyfour,or,fortyfive,years,old,she,might,have,passed,for,thirtyfive
She,still,had,her,rich,fair,hair,her,large,animated,intelligent,eyes,so,often,opened,by,intrigue,so,often,closed,by,the,blindness,of,love
She,had,still,her,nymphlike,form,so,that,when,her,back,was,turned,she,still,was,not,unlike,the,girl,who,had,jumped,with,Anne,of,Austria,over,the,moat,of,the,Tuileries,in,1563
In,all,other,respects,she,was,the,same,mad,creature,who,threw,over,her,amours,such,an,air,of,originality,as,to,make,them,proverbial,for,eccentricity,in,her,family
She,was,in,a,little,boudoir,hung,with,blue,damask,adorned,by,red,flowers,with,a,foliage,of,gold,looking,upon,a,garden,and,reclined,upon,a,sofa,her,head,supported,on,the,rich,tapestry,which,covered,it
She,held,a,book,in,her,hand,and,her,arm,was,supported,by,a,cushion
At,the,footmans,announcement,she,raised,herself,a,little,and,peeped,out,with,some,curiosity
He,was,dressed,in,violettinted,velvet,trimmed,with,silk,of,the,same,color
His,shoulderknots,were,of,burnished,silver,his,mantle,had,no,gold,nor,embroidery,on,it,a,simple,plume,of,violet,feathers,adorned,his,hat,his,boots,were,of,black,leather,and,at,his,girdle,hung,that,sword,with,a,magnificent,hilt,that,Porthos,had,so,often,admired,in,the,Rue,Feron
Splendid,lace,adorned,the,falling,collar,of,his,shirt,and,lace,fell,also,over,the,top,of,his,boots
In,his,whole,person,he,bore,such,an,impress,of,high,degree,that,Madame,de,Chevreuse,half,rose,from,her,seat,when,she,saw,him,and,made,him,a,sign,to,sit,down,near,her
The,footman,was,withdrawing,but,Athos,stopped,him,by,a,sign
Madame,he,said,to,the,duchess,I,have,had,the,boldness,to,present,myself,at,your,hotel,without,being,known,to,you,it,has,succeeded,since,you,deign,to,receive,me
I,have,now,the,boldness,to,ask,you,for,an,interview,of,half,an,hour,I,grant,it,monsieur,replied,Madame,de,Chevreuse,with,her,most,gracious,smile
But,that,is,not,all,madame
Oh,I,am,very,presuming,I,am,aware
The,interview,for,which,I,ask,is,of,us,two,alone,and,I,very,earnestly,wish,that,it,may,not,be,interrupted,I,am,not,at,home,to,any,one,said,the,Duchess,de,Chevreuse,to,the,footman
You,may,go,The,footman,went,out
There,ensued,a,brief,silence,during,which,these,two,persons,who,at,first,sight,recognized,each,other,so,clearly,as,of,noble,race,examined,each,other,without,embarrassment,on,either,side
The,duchess,was,the,first,to,speak
Well,sir,I,am,waiting,with,impatience,to,hear,what,you,wish,to,say,to,me,And,I,madame,replied,Athos,am,looking,with,admiration,Sir,said,Madame,de,Chevreuse,you,must,excuse,me,but,I,long,to,know,to,whom,I,am,talking
You,belong,to,the,court,doubtless,yet,I,have,never,seen,you,at,court
Have,you,by,any,chance,been,in,the,Bastile,No,madame,I,have,not,but,very,likely,I,am,on,the,road,to,it,Ah
then,tell,me,who,you,are,and,get,along,with,you,upon,your,journey,replied,the,duchess,with,the,gayety,which,made,her,so,charming,for,I,am,sufficiently,in,bad,odor,already,without,compromising,myself,still,more,Who,I,am,madame
My,name,has,been,mentioned,to,youthe,Comte,de,la,Fere,you,do,not,know,that,name
I,once,bore,another,which,you,knew,but,you,have,certainly,forgotten,it,Tell,it,me,sir,Formerly,said,the,count,I,was,Athos,Madame,de,Chevreuse,looked,astonished
The,name,was,not,wholly,forgotten,but,mixed,up,and,confused,with,ancient,recollections
Athos,said,she,wait,a,moment,And,she,placed,her,hands,on,her,brow,as,if,to,force,the,fugitive,ideas,it,contained,to,concentration,in,a,moment
Shall,I,help,you,madame,asked,Athos
This,Athos,was,connected,with,three,young,musketeers,named,Porthos,DArtagnan,and,He,stopped,short
And,Aramis,said,the,duchess,quickly
And,Aramis,I,see,you,have,not,forgotten,the,name,No,she,said,poor,Aramis,a,charming,man,elegant,discreet,and,a,writer,of,poetical,verses
I,am,afraid,he,has,turned,out,ill,she,added
He,has,he,is,an,abbé,Ah,what,a,misfortune,exclaimed,the,duchess,playing,carelessly,with,her,fan
Indeed,sir,I,thank,you,you,have,recalled,one,of,the,most,agreeable,recollections,of,my,youth,Will,you,permit,me,then,to,recall,another,to,you,Relating,to,him,Yes,and,no,Faith,said,Madame,de,Chevreuse,say,on
With,a,man,like,you,I,fear,nothing,Athos,bowed
Aramis,he,continued,was,intimate,with,a,young,needlewoman,from,Tours,a,cousin,of,his,named,Marie,Michon,Ah,I,knew,her,cried,the,duchess
It,was,to,her,he,wrote,from,the,siege,of,Rochelle,to,warn,her,of,a,plot,against,the,Duke,of,Buckingham,Exactly,so,will,you,allow,me,to,speak,to,you,of,her,If,replied,the,duchess,with,a,meaning,look,you,do,not,say,too,much,against,her,I,should,be,ungrateful,said,Athos,and,I,regard,ingratitude,not,as,a,fault,or,a,crime,but,as,a,vice,which,is,much,worse,You,ungrateful,to,Marie,Michon,monsieur,said,Madame,de,Chevreuse,trying,to,read,in,Athoss,eyes
You,never,knew,her,Eh,madame,who,knows,said,Athos
There,is,a,popular,proverb,to,the,effect,that,it,is,only,mountains,that,never,meet,and,popular,proverbs,contain,sometimes,a,wonderful,amount,of,truth,Oh,go,on,monsieur,go,on,said,Madame,de,Chevreuse,eagerly,you,cant,imagine,how,much,this,conversation,interests,me,You,encourage,me,said,Athos,I,will,continue,then
That,cousin,of,Aramis,that,Marie,Michon,that,needlewoman,notwithstanding,her,low,condition,had,acquaintances,in,the,highest,rank,she,called,the,grandest,ladies,of,the,court,her,friend,and,the,queenproud,as,she,is,in,her,double,character,as,Austrian,and,as,Spaniardcalled,her,her,sister,Alas,said,Madame,de,Chevreuse,with,a,slight,sigh,and,a,little,movement,of,her,eyebrows,that,was,peculiarly,her,own,since,that,time,everything,has,changed,And,the,queen,had,reason,for,her,affection,for,Marie,was,devoted,to,herdevoted,to,that,degree,that,she,served,her,as,medium,of,intercourse,with,her,brother,the,king,of,Spain,Which,interrupted,the,duchess,is,now,brought,up,against,her,as,a,great,crime,And,therefore,continued,Athos,the,cardinalthe,true,cardinal,the,other,onedetermined,one,fine,morning,to,arrest,poor,Marie,Michon,and,send,her,to,the,Chateau,de,Loches
Fortunately,the,affair,was,not,managed,so,secretly,but,that,it,became,known,to,the,queen
The,case,had,been,provided,for,if,Marie,Michon,should,be,threatened,with,any,danger,the,queen,was,to,send,her,a,prayerbook,bound,in,green,velvet,That,is,true,monsieur,you,are,well,informed,One,morning,the,green,book,was,brought,to,her,by,the,Prince,de,Marsillac
There,was,no,time,to,lose
Happily,Marie,and,a,follower,of,hers,named,Kitty,could,disguise,themselves,admirably,in,mens,clothes
The,prince,procured,for,Marie,Michon,the,dress,of,a,cavalier,and,for,Kitty,that,of,a,lackey,he,sent,them,two,excellent,horses,and,the,fugitives,went,out,hastily,from,Tours,shaping,their,course,toward,Spain,trembling,at,the,least,noise,following,unfrequented,roads,and,asking,for,hospitality,when,they,found,themselves,where,there,was,no,inn,Why,really,it,was,all,exactly,as,you,say,cried,Madame,de,Chevreuse,clapping,her,hands
It,would,indeed,be,strange,if,she,checked,herself
If,I,should,follow,the,two,fugitives,to,the,end,of,their,journey,said,Athos
No,madame,I,will,not,thus,waste,your,time

Her,face,as,she,looked,at,Athos,had,taken,on,an,expression,that,cannot,be,described
It,could,be,seen,that,she,had,wished,to,speak,but,she,had,remained,silent,through,fear,of,losing,one,of,her,companions,words
Ah,I,have,come,now,to,what,is,most,difficult,Speak,speak

Besides,it,doesnt,concern,me,it,relates,to,Mademoiselle,Marie,Michon,Ah,that,is,true,said,Athos
Well,then,Marie,Michon,had,supper,with,her,follower,and,then,in,accordance,with,the,permission,given,her,she,entered,the,chamber,of,her,host,Kitty,meanwhile,taking,possession,of,an,armchair,in,the,room,first,entered,where,they,had,taken,their,supper,Really,monsieur,said,Madame,de,Chevreuse,unless,you,are,the,devil,in,person,I,dont,know,how,you,could,become,acquainted,with,all,these,details,A,charming,woman,was,that,Marie,Michon,resumed,Athos,one,of,those,wild,creatures,who,are,constantly,conceiving,the,strangest,ideas

The,priest,having,all,confidence,in,his,guest,who,besides,was,a,nobleman,had,left,to,him,his,house,his,supper,and,his,chamber

Well,monsieur,le,comte,said,the,duchess,smiling,does,one,leave,so,solemnly,his,old,friends,Ah,murmured,Athos,kissing,her,hand,had,I,only,sooner,known,that,Marie,Michon,was,so,charming,a,creature,And,he,withdrew,sighing
There,was,once,in,the,Rue,des,Tournelles,a,house,known,by,all,the,sedan,chairmen,and,footmen,of,Paris,and,yet,nevertheless,this,house,was,neither,that,of,a,great,lord,nor,of,a,rich,man
There,was,neither,dining,nor,playing,at,cards,nor,dancing,in,that,house
Nevertheless,it,was,the,rendezvous,of,the,great,world,and,all,Paris,went,there
It,was,the,abode,of,the,little,Abbé,Scarron
In,the,home,of,the,witty,abbé,dwelt,incessant,laughter,there,all,the,items,of,the,day,had,their,source,and,were,so,quickly,transformed,misrepresented,metamorphosed,some,into,epigrams,some,into,falsehoods,that,every,one,was,anxious,to,pass,an,hour,with,little,Scarron,listening,to,what,he,said,reporting,it,to,others
The,diminutive,Abbé,Scarron,who,however,was,an,abbé,only,because,he,owned,an,abbey,and,not,because,he,was,in,orders,had,formerly,been,one,of,the,gayest,prebendaries,in,the,town,of,Mans,which,he,inhabited
On,a,day,of,the,carnival,he,had,taken,a,notion,to,provide,an,unusual,entertainment,for,that,good,town,of,which,he,was,the,life,and,soul
He,had,made,his,valet,cover,him,with,honey,then,opening,a,feather,bed,he,had,rolled,in,it,and,had,thus,become,the,most,grotesque,fowl,it,is,possible,to,imagine
He,then,began,to,visit,his,friends,of,both,sexes,in,that,strange,costume
At,first,he,had,been,followed,through,astonishment,then,with,derisive,shouts,then,the,porters,had,insulted,him,then,children,had,thrown,stones,at,him,and,finally,he,was,obliged,to,run,to,escape,the,missiles
As,soon,as,he,took,to,flight,every,one,pursued,him,until,pressed,on,all,sides,Scarron,found,no,way,of,escaping,his,escort,except,by,throwing,himself,into,the,river,but,the,water,was,icy,cold
Scarron,was,heated,the,cold,seized,on,him,and,when,he,reached,the,farther,bank,he,found,himself,crippled
Every,means,had,been,employed,in,vain,to,restore,the,use,of,his,limbs
He,had,been,subjected,to,a,severe,disciplinary,course,of,medicine,at,length,he,sent,away,all,his,doctors,declaring,that,he,preferred,the,disease,to,the,treatment,and,came,to,Paris,where,the,fame,of,his,wit,had,preceded,him
There,he,had,a,chair,made,on,his,own,plan,and,one,day,visiting,Anne,of,Austria,in,this,chair,she,asked,him,charmed,as,she,was,with,his,wit,if,he,did,not,wish,for,a,title
Yes,your,majesty,there,is,a,title,which,I,covet,much,replied,Scarron
And,what,is,that,That,of,being,your,invalid,answered,Scarron
So,he,was,called,the,queens,invalid,with,a,pension,of,fifteen,hundred,francs
From,that,lucky,moment,Scarron,led,a,happy,life,spending,both,income,and,principal
One,day,however,an,emissary,of,the,cardinals,gave,him,to,understand,that,he,was,wrong,in,receiving,the,coadjutor,so,often
And,why,asked,Scarron,is,he,not,a,man,of,good,birth,Certainly,Agreeable,Undeniably,Witty,He,has,unfortunately,too,much,wit,Well,then,why,do,you,wish,me,to,give,up,seeing,such,a,man,Because,he,is,an,enemy,Of,whom,Of,the,cardinal,What,answered,Scarron,I,continue,to,receive,Monsieur,Gilles,Despreaux,who,thinks,ill,of,me,and,you,wish,me,to,give,up,seeing,the,coadjutor,because,he,thinks,ill,of,another,man
Impossible,The,conversation,had,rested,there,and,Scarron,through,sheer,obstinacy,had,seen,Monsieur,de,Gondy,only,the,more,frequently
Now,the,very,morning,of,which,we,speak,was,that,of,his,quarterday,payment,and,Scarron,as,usual,had,sent,his,servant,to,get,his,money,at,the,pensionoffice,but,the,man,had,returned,and,said,that,the,government,had,no,more,money,to,give,Monsieur,Scarron
It,was,on,Thursday,the,abbés,reception,day,people,went,there,in,crowds
The,cardinals,refusal,to,pay,the,pension,was,known,about,the,town,in,half,an,hour,and,he,was,abused,with,wit,and,vehemence
In,the,Rue,Saint,Honore,Athos,fell,in,with,two,gentlemen,whom,he,did,not,know,on,horseback,like,himself,followed,by,a,lackey,like,himself,and,going,in,the,same,direction,that,he,was
One,of,them,hat,in,hand,said,to,him,Would,you,believe,it,monsieur
that,contemptible,Mazarin,has,stopped,poor,Scarrons,pension,That,is,unreasonable,said,Athos,saluting,in,his,turn,the,two,cavaliers
And,they,separated,with,courteous,gestures
It,happens,well,that,we,are,going,there,this,evening,said,Athos,to,the,vicomte,we,will,pay,our,compliments,to,that,poor,man,What,then,is,this,Monsieur,Scarron,who,thus,puts,all,Paris,in,commotion
Is,he,some,minister,out,of,office,Oh,no,not,at,all,vicomte,Athos,replied,he,is,simply,a,gentleman,of,great,genius,who,has,fallen,into,disgrace,with,the,cardinal,through,having,written,certain,verses,against,him,Do,gentlemen,then,make,verses,asked,Raoul,naively,I,thought,it,was,derogatory,So,it,is,my,dear,vicomte,said,Athos,laughing,to,make,bad,ones,but,to,make,good,ones,increases,famewitness,Monsieur,de,Rotrou
Nevertheless,he,continued,in,the,tone,of,one,who,gives,wholesome,advice,I,think,it,is,better,not,to,make,them,Then,said,Raoul,this,Monsieur,Scarron,is,a,poet,Yes,you,are,warned,vicomte
Consider,well,what,you,do,in,that,house
Talk,only,by,gestures,or,rather,always,listen,Yes,monsieur,replied,Raoul
You,will,see,me,talking,with,one,of,my,friends,the,Abbé,dHerblay,of,whom,you,have,often,heard,me,speak,I,remember,him,monsieur,Come,near,to,us,from,time,to,time,as,if,to,speak,but,do,not,speak,and,do,not,listen
That,little,stratagem,may,serve,to,keep,off,interlopers,Very,well,monsieur,I,will,obey,you,at,all,points,Athos,made,two,visits,in,Paris,at,seven,oclock,he,and,Raoul,directed,their,steps,to,the,Rue,des,Tournelles,it,was,stopped,by,porters,horses,and,footmen
Athos,forced,his,way,through,and,entered,followed,by,the,young,man
The,first,person,that,struck,him,on,his,entrance,was,Aramis,planted,near,a,great,chair,on,castors,very,large,covered,with,a,canopy,of,tapestry,under,which,there,moved,enveloped,in,a,quilt,of,brocade,a,little,face,youngish,very,merry,somewhat,pallid,whilst,its,eyes,never,ceased,to,express,a,sentiment,at,once,lively,intellectual,and,amiable
This,was,the,Abbé,Scarron,always,laughing,joking,complimentingyet,sufferingand,toying,nervously,with,a,small,switch
Around,this,kind,of,rolling,tent,pressed,a,crowd,of,gentlemen,and,ladies
The,room,was,neatly,comfortably,furnished
Large,valances,of,silk,embroidered,with,flowers,of,gay,colors,which,were,rather,faded,fell,from,the,wide,windows,the,fittings,of,the,room,were,simple,but,in,excellent,taste
Two,well,trained,servingmen,were,in,attendance,on,the,company
On,perceiving,Athos,Aramis,advanced,toward,him,took,him,by,the,hand,and,presented,him,to,Scarron
Raoul,remained,silent,for,he,was,not,prepared,for,the,dignity,of,the,bel,esprit
After,some,minutes,the,door,opened,and,a,footman,announced,Mademoiselle,Paulet
Athos,touched,the,shoulder,of,the,vicomte
Look,at,this,lady,Raoul,she,is,an,historic,personage,it,was,to,visit,her,King,Henry,IV

She,was,a,tall,woman,with,a,slender,figure,and,a,forest,of,golden,curls,such,as,Raphael,was,fond,of,and,Titian,has,painted,all,his,Magdalens,with
This,fawncolored,hair,or,perhaps,the,sort,of,ascendancy,which,she,had,over,other,women,gave,her,the,name,of,La,Lionne,Mademoiselle,Paulet,took,her,accustomed,seat,but,before,sitting,down,she,cast,in,all,her,queenlike,grandeur,a,look,around,the,room,and,her,eyes,rested,on,Raoul

Presentlythere,are,not,a,sufficient,number,of,people,here,yet,we,shall,be,remarked,At,this,moment,the,door,opened,and,in,walked,the,coadjutor
At,this,name,every,one,looked,around,for,his,was,already,a,very,celebrated,name
He,knew,the,Abbé,de,Gondy,only,by,report
He,saw,a,little,dark,man,ill,made,and,awkward,with,his,hands,in,everythingexcept,drawing,a,sword,and,firing,a,pistolwith,something,haughty,and,contemptuous,in,his,face
Scarron,turned,around,toward,him,and,came,to,meet,him,in,his,chair

But,how,can,you,continue,to,receive,us,asked,the,coadjutor,if,your,income,is,lessened,I,shall,be,obliged,to,make,you,a,canon,of,Notre,Dame,Oh,no,cried,Scarron,I,should,compromise,you,too,much,Perhaps,you,have,resources,of,which,we,are,ignorant,I,shall,borrow,from,the,queen,But,her,majesty,has,no,property,interposed,Aramis
At,this,moment,the,door,opened,and,Madame,de,Chevreuse,was,announced
Scarron,turned,his,chair,toward,the,door,Raoul,blushed,Athos,made,a,sign,to,Aramis,who,went,and,hid,himself,in,the,enclosure,of,a,window
In,the,midst,of,all,the,compliments,that,awaited,her,on,her,entrance,the,duchess,seemed,to,be,looking,for,some,one,at,last,she,found,out,Raoul,and,her,eyes,sparkled,she,perceived,Athos,and,became,thoughtful,she,saw,Aramis,in,the,seclusion,of,the,window,and,gave,a,start,of,surprise,behind,her,fan

For,my,part,I,always,thought,his,poetry,detestable,and,I,think,I,know,something,about,poetry,Who,is,this,officer,inquired,Raoul,of,Athos,who,is,speaking,Monsieur,de,Scudery,the,author,of,Clelie,and,of,Le,Grand,Cyrus,which,were,composed,partly,by,him,and,partly,by,his,sister,who,is,now,talking,to,that,pretty,person,yonder,near,Monsieur,Scarron,Raoul,turned,and,saw,two,faces,just,arrived
One,was,perfectly,charming,delicate,pensive,shaded,by,beautiful,dark,hair,and,eyes,soft,as,velvet,like,those,lovely,flowers,the,heartsease,in,which,shine,out,the,golden,petals
The,other,of,mature,age,seemed,to,have,the,former,one,under,her,charge,and,was,cold,dry,and,yellowthe,true,type,of,a,duenna,or,a,devotee
Raoul,resolved,not,to,quit,the,room,without,having,spoken,to,the,beautiful,girl,with,the,soft,eyes,who,by,a,strange,fancy,although,she,bore,no,resemblance,reminded,him,of,his,poor,little,Louise,whom,he,had,left,in,the,Chateau,de,la,Valliere,and,whom,in,the,midst,of,all,the,party,he,had,never,for,one,moment,quite,forgotten
Meantime,Aramis,had,drawn,near,to,the,coadjutor,who,smiling,all,the,while,contrived,to,drop,some,words,into,his,ear
Aramis,notwithstanding,his,selfcontrol,could,not,refrain,from,a,slight,movement,of,surprise
Laugh,then,said,Monsieur,de,Retz,they,are,looking,at,us,And,leaving,Aramis,he,went,to,talk,with,Madame,de,Chevreuse,who,was,in,the,midst,of,a,large,group
Aramis,affected,a,laugh,to,divert,the,attention,of,certain,curious,listeners,and,perceiving,that,Athos,had,betaken,himself,to,the,embrasure,of,a,window,and,remained,there,he,proceeded,to,join,him,throwing,out,a,few,words,carelessly,as,he,moved,through,the,room
As,soon,as,the,two,friends,met,they,began,a,conversation,which,was,emphasized,by,frequent,gesticulation
Raoul,then,approached,them,as,Athos,had,directed,him,to,do
Tis,a,rondeau,by,Monsieur,Voiture,that,monsieur,labbé,is,repeating,to,me,said,Athos,in,a,loud,voice,and,I,confess,I,think,it,incomparable,Raoul,stayed,only,a,few,minutes,near,them,and,then,mingled,with,the,group,round,Madame,de,Chevreuse
Well,then,asked,Athos,in,a,low,tone
It,is,to,be,tomorrow,said,Aramis,hastily
At,what,time,Six,oclock,Where,At,Saint,Mande,Who,told,you,The,Count,de,Rochefort,Some,one,drew,near
And,then,philosophic,ideas,are,wholly,wanting,in,Voitures,works,but,I,am,of,the,same,opinion,as,the,coadjutorhe,is,a,poet,a,true,poet,Aramis,spoke,so,as,to,be,heard,by,everybody
And,I,too,murmured,the,young,lady,with,the,velvet,eyes
I,have,the,misfortune,also,to,admire,his,poetry,exceedingly,Monsieur,Scarron,do,me,the,honor,said,Raoul,blushing,to,tell,me,the,name,of,that,young,lady,whose,opinion,seems,so,different,from,that,of,others,of,the,company,Ah
my,young,vicomte,replied,Scarron,I,suppose,you,wish,to,propose,to,her,an,alliance,offensive,and,defensive,Raoul,blushed,again
You,asked,the,name,of,that,young,lady
She,is,called,the,fair,Indian,Excuse,me,sir,returned,Raoul,blushing,still,more,deeply,I,know,no,more,than,I,did,before
I,am,from,the,country,Which,means,that,you,know,very,little,about,the,nonsense,which,here,flows,down,our,streets
So,much,the,better,young,man
Dont,try,to,understand,ityou,will,only,lose,your,time,You,forgive,me,then,sir,said,Raoul,and,you,will,deign,to,tell,me,who,is,the,person,that,you,call,the,young,Indian,Certainly,one,of,the,most,charming,persons,that,livesMademoiselle,Frances,dAubigne,Does,she,belong,to,the,family,of,the,celebrated,Agrippa,the,friend,of,Henry,IV
She,comes,from,Martinique,so,I,call,her,the,beautiful,Indian,Raoul,looked,surprised,and,his,eyes,met,those,of,the,young,lady,who,smiled
The,company,went,on,speaking,of,the,poet,Voiture
Monsieur,said,Mademoiselle,dAubigne,to,Scarron,as,if,she,wished,to,join,in,the,conversation,he,was,engaged,in,with,Raoul,do,you,not,admire,Monsieur,Voitures,friends
Listen,how,they,pull,him,to,pieces,even,whilst,they,praise,him,one,takes,away,from,him,all,claim,to,good,sense,another,robs,him,of,his,poetry,a,third,of,his,originality,another,of,his,humor,another,of,his,independence,of,character,a,sixthbut,good,heavens
as,Mademoiselle,de,Scudery,remarks,Scarron,and,Raoul,laughed
The,fair,Indian,astonished,at,the,sensation,her,observation,produced,looked,down,and,resumed,her,air,of,naivete
Athos,still,within,the,inclosure,of,the,window,watched,this,scene,with,a,smile,of,disdain,on,his,lips
Tell,the,Comte,de,la,Fere,to,come,to,me,said,Madame,de,Chevreuse,I,want,to,speak,to,him,And,I,said,the,coadjutor,want,it,to,be,thought,that,I,do,not,speak,to,him
I,admire,I,love,himfor,I,know,his,former,adventuresbut,I,shall,not,speak,to,him,until,the,day,after,tomorrow,And,why,day,after,tomorrow,asked,Madame,de,Chevreuse
You,will,know,that,tomorrow,evening,said,the,coadjutor,smiling
Really,my,dear,Gondy,said,the,duchess,you,remind,one,of,the,Apocalypse
Monsieur,dHerblay,she,added,turning,toward,Aramis,will,you,be,my,servant,once,more,this,evening,How,can,you,doubt,it,replied,Aramis,this,evening,tomorrow,always,command,me,I,will,then
Go,and,look,for,the,Comte,de,la,Fere,I,wish,to,speak,with,him,Aramis,found,Athos,and,brought,him
Monsieur,le,comte,said,the,duchess,giving,him,a,letter,here,is,what,I,promised,you,our,young,friend,will,be,extremely,well,received,Madame,he,is,very,happy,in,owing,any,obligation,to,you,You,have,no,reason,to,envy,him,on,that,score,for,I,owe,to,you,the,pleasure,of,knowing,him,replied,the,witty,woman,with,a,smile,which,recalled,Marie,Michon,to,Aramis,and,to,Athos
As,she,uttered,that,bon,mot,she,arose,and,asked,for,her,carriage
Mademoiselle,Paulet,had,already,gone,Mademoiselle,de,Scudery,was,going
Vicomte,said,Athos,to,Raoul,follow,the,duchess,beg,her,to,do,you,the,favor,to,take,your,arm,in,going,downstairs,and,thank,her,as,you,descend,The,fair,Indian,approached,Scarron
You,are,going,already,he,said
One,of,the,last,as,you,see,if,you,hear,anything,of,Monsieur,Voiture,be,so,kind,as,to,send,me,word,tomorrow,Oh,said,Scarron,he,may,die,now,Why,asked,the,young,girl,with,the,velvet,eyes
Certainly,his,panegyric,has,been,uttered,They,parted,laughing,she,turning,back,to,gaze,at,the,poor,paralytic,man,with,interest,he,looking,after,her,with,eyes,of,love
One,by,one,the,several,groups,broke,up
Scarron,seemed,not,to,observe,that,certain,of,his,guests,had,talked,mysteriously,that,letters,had,passed,from,hand,to,hand,and,that,the,assembly,had,seemed,to,have,a,secret,purpose,quite,apart,from,the,literary,discussion,carried,on,with,so,much,ostentation
What,was,all,that,to,Scarron
At,his,house,rebellion,could,be,planned,with,impunity,for,as,we,have,said,since,that,morning,he,had,ceased,to,be,the,queens,invalid,As,to,Raoul,he,had,attended,the,duchess,to,her,carriage,where,as,she,took,her,seat,she,gave,him,her,hand,to,kiss,then,by,one,of,those,wild,caprices,which,made,her,so,adorable,and,at,the,same,time,so,dangerous,she,had,suddenly,put,her,arm,around,his,neck,and,kissed,his,forehead,saying,Vicomte,may,my,good,wishes,and,this,kiss,bring,you,good,fortune,Then,she,had,pushed,him,away,and,directed,the,coachman,to,stop,at,the,Hotel,de,Luynes
The,carriage,had,started,Madame,de,Chevreuse,had,made,a,parting,gesture,to,the,young,man,and,Raoul,had,returned,in,a,state,of,stupefaction
Athos,surmised,what,had,taken,place,and,smiled
Come,vicomte,he,said,it,is,time,for,you,to,go,to,bed,you,will,start,in,the,morning,for,the,army,of,monsieur,le,prince
Sleep,well,your,last,night,as,citizen,I,am,to,be,a,soldier,then,said,the,young,man
Oh,monsieur,I,thank,you,with,all,my,heart,Adieu,count,said,the,Abbé,dHerblay,I,return,to,my,convent,Adieu,abbé,said,the,coadjutor,I,am,to,preach,tomorrow,and,have,twenty,texts,to,examine,this,evening,Adieu,gentlemen,said,the,count,I,am,going,to,sleep,twentyfour,hours,I,am,just,falling,down,with,fatigue,The,three,men,saluted,one,another,whilst,exchanging,a,last,look
Scarron,followed,their,movements,with,a,glance,from,the,corner,of,his,eye
Not,one,of,them,will,do,as,he,says,he,murmured,with,his,little,monkey,smile,but,they,may,do,as,they,please,the,brave,gentlemen
Who,knows,if,they,will,not,manage,to,restore,to,me,my,pension
They,can,move,their,arms,they,can,and,that,is,much
Alas,I,have,only,my,tongue,but,I,will,try,to,show,that,it,is,good,for,something
Come,and,roll,me,to,bed
Really,that,Demoiselle,dAubigne,is,very,charming,So,the,invalid,disappeared,soon,afterward,and,went,into,his,sleepingroom,and,one,by,one,the,lights,in,the,salon,of,the,Rue,des,Tournelles,were,extinguished
The,day,had,begun,to,break,when,Athos,arose,and,dressed,himself
It,was,plain,by,a,paleness,still,greater,than,usual,and,by,those,traces,which,loss,of,sleep,leaves,on,the,face,that,he,must,have,passed,almost,the,whole,of,the,night,without,sleeping
Contrary,to,the,custom,of,a,man,so,firm,and,decided,there,was,this,morning,in,his,personal,appearance,something,tardy,and,irresolute
He,was,occupied,with,the,preparations,for,Raouls,departure,and,was,seeking,to,gain,time
In,the,first,place,he,himself,furbished,a,sword,which,he,drew,from,its,perfumed,leather,sheath,he,examined,it,to,see,if,its,hilt,was,well,guarded,and,if,the,blade,was,firmly,attached,to,the,hilt
Then,he,placed,at,the,bottom,of,the,valise,belonging,to,the,young,man,a,small,bag,of,louis,called,Olivain,the,lackey,who,had,followed,him,from,Blois,and,made,him,pack,the,valise,under,his,own,eyes,watchful,to,see,that,everything,should,be,put,in,which,might,be,useful,to,a,young,man,entering,on,his,first,campaign
At,length,after,occupying,about,an,hour,in,these,preparations,he,opened,the,door,of,the,room,in,which,the,vicomte,slept,and,entered
The,sun,already,high,penetrated,into,the,room,through,the,window,the,curtains,of,which,Raoul,had,neglected,to,close,on,the,previous,evening
He,was,still,sleeping,his,head,gracefully,reposing,on,his,arm
Athos,approached,and,hung,over,the,youth,in,an,attitude,full,of,tender,melancholy,he,looked,long,on,this,young,man,whose,smiling,mouth,and,half,closed,eyes,bespoke,soft,dreams,and,lightest,slumber,as,if,his,guardian,angel,watched,over,him,with,solicitude,and,affection
By,degrees,Athos,gave,himself,up,to,the,charms,of,his,reverie,in,the,proximity,of,youth,so,pure,so,fresh
His,own,youth,seemed,to,reappear,bringing,with,it,all,those,savoury,remembrances,which,are,like,perfumes,more,than,thoughts
Between,the,past,and,the,present,was,an,ineffable,abyss
But,imagination,has,the,wings,of,an,angel,of,light,and,travels,safely,through,or,over,the,seas,where,we,have,been,almost,shipwrecked,the,darkness,in,which,our,illusions,are,lost,the,precipice,whence,our,happiness,has,been,hurled,and,swallowed,up
He,remembered,that,all,the,first,part,of,his,life,had,been,embittered,by,a,woman,and,he,thought,with,alarm,of,the,influence,love,might,assume,over,so,fine,and,at,the,same,time,so,vigorous,an,organization,as,that,of,Raoul
In,recalling,all,he,had,been,through,he,foresaw,all,that,Raoul,might,suffer,and,the,expression,of,the,deep,and,tender,compassion,which,throbbed,in,his,heart,was,pictured,in,the,moist,eye,with,which,he,gazed,on,the,young,man
At,this,moment,Raoul,awoke,without,a,cloud,on,his,face,without,weariness,or,lassitude,his,eyes,were,fixed,on,those,of,Athos,and,perhaps,he,comprehended,all,that,passed,in,the,heart,of,the,man,who,was,awaiting,his,awakening,as,a,lover,awaits,the,awakening,of,his,mistress,for,his,glance,in,return,had,all,the,tenderness,of,love
You,are,there,sir,he,said,respectfully
And,you,did,not,awaken,me,I,wished,to,leave,you,still,to,enjoy,some,moments,of,sleep,my,child,you,must,be,fatigued,from,yesterday,Oh,sir,how,good,you,are,Athos,smiled
How,do,you,feel,this,morning,he,inquired
Perfectly,well,quite,rested,sir,You,are,still,growing,Athos,continued,with,that,charming,and,paternal,interest,felt,by,a,grown,man,for,a,youth
Oh,sir,I,beg,your,pardon,exclaimed,Raoul,ashamed,of,so,much,attention,in,an,instant,I,shall,be,dressed,Athos,then,called,Olivain
Everything,said,Olivain,to,Athos,has,been,done,according,to,your,directions,the,horses,are,waiting,And,I,was,asleep,cried,Raoul,whilst,you,sir,you,had,the,kindness,to,attend,to,all,these,details
Truly,sir,you,overwhelm,me,with,benefits,Therefore,you,love,me,a,little,I,hope,replied,Athos,in,a,tone,of,emotion
God,knows,how,much,I,love,revere,you,See,that,you,forget,nothing,said,Athos,appearing,to,look,about,him,that,he,might,hide,his,emotion
The,servant,then,approached,Athos,and,said,hesitatingly,Monsieur,le,vicomte,has,no,sword,Tis,well,said,Athos,I,will,take,care,of,that,They,went,downstairs,Raoul,looking,every,now,and,then,at,the,count,to,see,if,the,moment,of,farewell,was,at,hand,but,Athos,was,silent
When,they,reached,the,steps,Raoul,saw,three,horses
then,you,are,going,with,me,I,will,accompany,you,a,portion,of,the,way,said,Athos
Joy,shone,in,Raouls,eyes,and,he,leaped,lightly,to,his,saddle
Athos,mounted,more,slowly,after,speaking,in,a,low,voice,to,the,lackey,who,instead,of,following,them,immediately,returned,to,their,rooms
Raoul,delighted,at,the,counts,companionship,perceived,or,affected,to,perceive,nothing,of,this,byplay
They,set,out,passing,over,the,Pont,Neuf,they,pursued,their,way,along,the,quay,then,called,LAbreuvoir,Pepin,and,went,along,by,the,walls,of,the,Grand,Chatelet
They,proceeded,to,the,Rue,Saint,Denis
After,passing,through,the,Porte,Saint,Denis,Athos,looked,at,Raouls,way,of,riding,and,observed,Take,care,Raoul
I,have,already,often,told,you,of,this,you,must,not,forget,it,for,it,is,a,great,defect,in,a,rider
your,horse,is,tired,already,he,froths,at,the,mouth,whilst,mine,looks,as,if,he,had,only,just,left,the,stable
You,hold,the,bit,too,tight,and,so,make,his,mouth,hard,so,that,you,will,not,be,able,to,make,him,manoeuvre,quickly
The,safety,of,a,cavalier,often,depends,on,the,prompt,obedience,of,his,horse
In,a,week,remember,you,will,no,longer,be,performing,your,manoeuvres,for,practice,but,on,a,field,of,battle,Then,suddenly,in,order,not,to,give,too,uncomfortable,an,importance,to,this,observation,See,Raoul,he,resumed,what,a,fine,plain,for,partridge,shooting,The,young,man,stored,in,his,mind,the,admonition,whilst,he,admired,the,delicate,tenderness,with,which,it,was,bestowed
I,have,remarked,also,another,thing,said,Athos,which,is,that,in,firing,off,your,pistol,you,hold,your,arm,too,far,outstretched
This,tension,lessens,the,accuracy,of,the,aim
So,in,twelve,times,you,thrice,missed,the,mark,Which,you,sir,struck,twelve,times,answered,Raoul,smiling
Because,I,bent,my,arm,and,rested,my,hand,on,my,elbowso,do,you,understand,what,I,mean,Yes,sir
I,have,fired,since,in,that,manner,and,have,been,quite,successful,What,a,cold,wind,resumed,Athos,a,wintry,blast
Apropos,if,you,fireand,you,will,do,so,for,you,are,recommended,to,a,young,general,who,is,very,fond,of,powderremember,that,in,single,combat,which,often,takes,place,in,the,cavalry,never,to,fire,the,first,shot
He,who,fires,the,first,shot,rarely,hits,his,man,for,he,fires,with,the,apprehension,of,being,disarmed,before,an,armed,foe,then,whilst,he,fires,make,your,horse,rear,that,manoeuvre,has,saved,my,life,several,times,I,shall,do,so,if,only,in,gratitude,Eh,cried,Athos,are,not,those,fellows,poachers,they,have,arrested,yonder
Then,another,important,thing,Raoul,should,you,be,wounded,in,a,battle,and,fall,from,your,horse,if,you,have,any,strength,left,disentangle,yourself,from,the,line,that,your,regiment,has,formed,otherwise,it,may,be,driven,back,and,you,will,be,trampled,to,death,by,the,horses
At,all,events,should,you,be,wounded,write,to,me,that,very,instant,or,get,some,one,at,once,to,write,to,me
We,are,judges,of,wounds,we,old,soldiers,Athos,added,smiling
Thank,you,sir,answered,the,young,man,much,moved
They,arrived,that,very,moment,at,the,gate,of,the,town,guarded,by,two,sentinels
Here,comes,a,young,gentleman,said,one,of,them,who,seems,as,if,he,were,going,to,join,the,army,How,do,you,make,that,out,inquired,Athos
By,his,manner,sir,and,his,age,hes,the,second,today,Has,a,young,man,such,as,I,am,gone,through,this,morning,then,asked,Raoul
Faith,yes,with,a,haughty,presence,a,fine,equipage,such,as,the,son,of,a,noble,house,would,have,He,will,be,my,companion,on,the,journey,sir,cried,Raoul
he,cannot,make,me,forget,what,I,shall,have,lost,Thus,talking,they,traversed,the,streets,full,of,people,on,account,of,the,fete,and,arrived,opposite,the,old,cathedral,where,first,mass,was,going,on
Let,us,alight,Raoul,said,Athos
Olivain,take,care,of,our,horses,and,give,me,my,sword,The,two,gentlemen,then,went,into,the,church
Athos,gave,Raoul,some,of,the,holy,water
A,love,as,tender,as,that,of,a,lover,for,his,mistress,dwells,undoubtedly,in,some,paternal,hearts,toward,a,son
Athos,said,a,word,to,one,of,the,vergers,who,bowed,and,proceeded,toward,the,basement
Come,Raoul,he,said,let,us,follow,this,man,The,verger,opened,the,iron,grating,that,guarded,the,royal,tombs,and,stood,on,the,topmost,step,whilst,Athos,and,Raoul,descended
The,sepulchral,depths,of,the,descent,were,dimly,lighted,by,a,silver,lamp,on,the,lowest,step,and,just,below,this,lamp,there,was,laid,wrapped,in,a,flowing,mantle,of,violet,velvet,worked,with,fleursdelis,of,gold,a,catafalque,resting,on,trestles,of,oak
The,young,man,prepared,for,this,scene,by,the,state,of,his,own,feelings,which,were,mournful,and,by,the,majesty,of,the,cathedral,which,he,had,passed,through,descended,in,a,slow,and,solemn,manner,and,stood,with,head,uncovered,before,these,mortal,spoils,of,the,last,king,who,was,not,to,be,placed,by,the,side,of,his,forefathers,until,his,successor,should,take,his,place,there,and,who,appeared,to,abide,on,that,spot,that,he,might,thus,address,human,pride,so,sure,to,be,exalted,by,the,glories,of,a,throne,Dust,of,the,earth
Here,I,await,thee,There,was,profound,silence
Then,Athos,raised,his,hand,and,pointing,to,the,coffin,This,temporary,sepulture,is,he,said,that,of,a,man,who,was,of,feeble,mind,yet,one,whose,reign,was,full,of,great,events,because,over,this,king,watched,the,spirit,of,another,man,even,as,this,lamp,keeps,vigil,over,this,coffin,and,illumines,it
He,whose,intellect,was,thus,supreme,Raoul,was,the,actual,sovereign,the,other,nothing,but,a,phantom,to,whom,he,lent,a,soul,and,yet,so,powerful,is,majesty,amongst,us,this,man,has,not,even,the,honor,of,a,tomb,at,the,feet,of,him,in,whose,service,his,life,was,worn,away
If,Richelieu,made,the,king,by,comparison,seem,small,he,made,royalty,great
The,Palace,of,the,Louvre,contains,two,thingsthe,king,who,must,die,and,royalty,which,never,dies
The,minister,so,feared,so,hated,by,his,master,has,descended,into,the,tomb,drawing,after,him,the,king,whom,he,would,not,leave,alone,on,earth,lest,his,work,should,be,destroyed
So,blind,were,his,contemporaries,that,they,regarded,the,cardinals,death,as,a,deliverance,and,I,even,I,opposed,the,designs,of,the,great,man,who,held,the,destinies,of,France,within,the,hollow,of,his,hand
Raoul,learn,how,to,distinguish,the,king,from,royalty,the,king,is,but,a,man,royalty,is,the,gift,of,God
Whenever,you,hesitate,as,to,whom,you,ought,to,serve,abandon,the,exterior,the,material,appearance,for,the,invisible,principle,for,the,invisible,principle,is,everything
Raoul,I,seem,to,read,your,future,destiny,as,through,a,cloud
It,will,be,happier,I,think,than,ours,has,been
Different,in,your,fate,from,us,you,will,have,a,king,without,a,minister,whom,you,may,serve,love,respect

Yours,is,a,noble,nature,he,said,here,is,your,sword,Raoul,bent,his,knee,to,the,ground
It,was,worn,by,my,father,a,loyal,gentleman
I,have,worn,it,in,my,turn,and,it,has,sometimes,not,been,disgraced,when,the,hilt,was,in,my,hand,and,the,sheath,at,my,side
Should,your,hand,still,be,too,weak,to,use,this,sword,Raoul,so,much,the,better
You,will,have,the,more,time,to,learn,to,draw,it,only,when,it,ought,to,be,used,Sir,replied,Raoul,putting,the,sword,to,his,lips,as,he,received,it,from,the,count,I,owe,you,everything,and,yet,this,sword,is,the,most,precious,gift,you,have,yet,made,me
I,will,wear,it,I,swear,to,you,as,a,grateful,man,should,do,Tis,well,arise,vicomte,embrace,me,Raoul,arose,and,threw,himself,with,emotion,into,the,counts,arms
Adieu,faltered,the,count,who,felt,his,heart,die,away,within,him,adieu,and,think,of,me,Oh

Olivain,said,Athos,showing,the,servant,Raouls,shoulderbelt,tighten,the,buckle,of,the,sword,it,falls,too,low
You,will,accompany,monsieur,le,vicomte,till,Grimaud,rejoins,you

Athos,remained,motionless,looking,after,him,until,he,turned,the,corner,of,the,street
Then,the,count,threw,the,bridle,of,his,horse,into,the,hands,of,a,peasant,remounted,the,steps,went,into,the,cathedral,there,to,kneel,down,in,the,darkest,corner,and,pray
One,of,the,Forty,Methods,of,Escape,of,the,Duc,de,Beaufort
Meanwhile,time,was,passing,on,for,the,prisoner,as,well,as,for,those,who,were,preparing,his,escape,only,for,him,it,passed,more,slowly
Unlike,other,men,who,enter,with,ardor,upon,a,perilous,resolution,and,grow,cold,as,the,moment,of,execution,approaches,the,Duc,de,Beaufort,whose,buoyant,courage,had,become,a,proverb,seemed,to,push,time,before,him,and,sought,most,eagerly,to,hasten,the,hour,of,action
In,his,escape,alone,apart,from,his,plans,for,the,future,which,it,must,be,admitted,were,for,the,present,sufficiently,vague,and,uncertain,there,was,a,beginning,of,vengeance,which,filled,his,heart
In,the,first,place,his,escape,would,be,a,serious,misfortune,to,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,whom,he,hated,for,the,petty,persecutions,he,owed,to,him
It,would,be,a,still,worse,affair,for,Mazarin,whom,he,execrated,for,the,greater,offences,he,had,committed
It,may,be,observed,that,there,was,a,proper,proportion,in,his,sentiments,toward,the,governor,of,the,prison,and,the,ministertoward,the,subordinate,and,the,master
Then,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,who,was,so,familiar,with,the,interior,of,the,Palais,Royal,though,he,did,not,know,the,relations,existing,between,the,queen,and,the,cardinal,pictured,to,himself,in,his,prison,all,that,dramatic,excitement,which,would,ensue,when,the,rumor,should,run,from,the,ministers,cabinet,to,the,chamber,of,Anne,of,Austria,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,has,escaped,Whilst,saying,that,to,himself,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,smiled,pleasantly,and,imagined,himself,already,outside,breathing,the,air,of,the,plains,and,the,forests,pressing,a,strong,horse,between,his,knees,and,crying,out,in,a,loud,voice,I,am,free,It,is,true,that,on,coming,to,himself,he,found,that,he,was,still,within,four,walls,he,saw,La,Ramee,twirling,his,thumbs,ten,feet,from,him,and,his,guards,laughing,and,drinking,in,the,antechamber
The,only,thing,that,was,pleasant,to,him,in,that,odious,tableausuch,is,the,instability,of,the,human,mindwas,the,sullen,face,of,Grimaud,for,whom,he,had,at,first,conceived,such,a,hatred,and,who,now,was,all,his,hope
Grimaud,seemed,to,him,an,Antinous
It,is,needless,to,say,that,this,transformation,was,visible,only,to,the,prisoners,feverish,imagination
Grimaud,was,still,the,same,and,therefore,he,retained,the,entire,confidence,of,his,superior,La,Ramee,who,now,relied,upon,him,more,than,he,did,upon,himself,for,as,we,have,said,La,Ramee,felt,at,the,bottom,of,his,heart,a,certain,weakness,for,Monsieur,de,Beaufort
And,so,the,good,La,Ramee,made,a,festivity,of,the,little,supper,with,his,prisoner
He,had,but,one,faulthe,was,a,gourmand,he,had,found,the,pates,good,the,wine,excellent
Now,the,successor,of,Pere,Marteau,had,promised,him,a,pate,of,pheasant,instead,of,a,pate,of,fowl,and,Chambertin,wine,instead,of,Macon
All,this,set,off,by,the,presence,of,that,excellent,prince,who,was,so,goodnatured,who,invented,so,droll,tricks,against,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,and,so,fine,jokes,against,Mazarin,made,for,La,Ramee,the,approaching,Pentecost,one,of,the,four,great,feasts,of,the,year
He,therefore,looked,forward,to,six,oclock,with,as,much,impatience,as,the,duke,himself
Since,daybreak,La,Ramee,had,been,occupied,with,the,preparations,and,trusting,no,one,but,himself,he,had,visited,personally,the,successor,of,Pere,Marteau
The,latter,had,surpassed,himself,he,showed,La,Ramee,a,monstrous,pate,ornamented,with,Monsieur,de,Beauforts,coatofarms
It,was,empty,as,yet,but,a,pheasant,and,two,partridges,were,lying,near,it
La,Ramees,mouth,watered,and,he,returned,to,the,dukes,chamber,rubbing,his,hands
To,crown,his,happiness,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,had,started,on,a,journey,that,morning,and,in,his,absence,La,Ramee,was,deputygovernor,of,the,chateau
As,for,Grimaud,he,seemed,more,sullen,than,ever
In,the,course,of,the,forenoon,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,had,a,game,of,tennis,with,La,Ramee,a,sign,from,Grimaud,put,him,on,the,alert
Grimaud,going,in,advance,followed,the,course,which,they,were,to,take,in,the,evening
The,game,was,played,in,an,inclosure,called,the,little,court,of,the,chateau,a,place,quite,deserted,except,when,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,was,playing,and,even,then,the,precaution,seemed,superfluous,the,wall,was,so,high
There,were,three,gates,to,open,before,reaching,the,inclosure,each,by,a,different,key
When,they,arrived,Grimaud,went,carelessly,and,sat,down,by,a,loophole,in,the,wall,letting,his,legs,dangle,outside
It,was,evident,that,there,the,rope,ladder,was,to,be,attached
This,manoeuvre,transparent,to,the,Duc,de,Beaufort,was,quite,unintelligible,to,La,Ramee
The,game,at,tennis,which,upon,a,sign,from,Grimaud,Monsieur,de,Beaufort,had,consented,to,play,began,in,the,afternoon
The,duke,was,in,full,strength,and,beat,La,Ramee,completely
Four,of,the,guards,who,were,constantly,near,the,prisoner,assisted,in,picking,up,the,tennis,balls
When,the,game,was,over,the,duke,laughing,at,La,Ramee,for,his,bad,play,offered,these,men,two,louis,dor,to,go,and,drink,his,health,with,their,four,other,comrades
The,guards,asked,permission,of,La,Ramee,who,gave,it,to,them,but,not,till,the,evening,however,until,then,he,had,business,and,the,prisoner,was,not,to,be,left,alone
Six,oclock,came,and,although,they,were,not,to,sit,down,to,table,until,seven,oclock,dinner,was,ready,and,served,up
Upon,a,sideboard,appeared,the,colossal,pie,with,the,dukes,arms,on,it,and,seemingly,cooked,to,a,turn,as,far,as,one,could,judge,by,the,golden,color,which,illuminated,the,crust
The,rest,of,the,dinner,was,to,come
Every,one,was,impatient,La,Ramee,to,sit,down,to,table,the,guards,to,go,and,drink,the,duke,to,escape
Grimaud,alone,was,calm,as,ever
One,might,have,fancied,that,Athos,had,educated,him,with,the,express,forethought,of,such,a,great,event
There,were,moments,when,looking,at,Grimaud,the,duke,asked,himself,if,he,was,not,dreaming,and,if,that,marble,figure,was,really,at,his,service,and,would,grow,animated,when,the,moment,came,for,action
La,Ramee,sent,away,the,guards,desiring,them,to,drink,to,the,dukes,health,and,as,soon,as,they,were,gone,shut,all,the,doors,put,the,keys,in,his,pocket,and,showed,the,table,to,the,prince,with,an,air,that,signified,Whenever,my,lord,pleases,The,prince,looked,at,Grimaud,Grimaud,looked,at,the,clock,it,was,hardly,a,quarterpast,six
The,escape,was,fixed,to,take,place,at,seven,oclock,there,was,therefore,threequarters,of,an,hour,to,wait
The,duke,in,order,to,pass,away,another,quarter,of,an,hour,pretended,to,be,reading,something,that,interested,him,and,muttered,that,he,wished,they,would,allow,him,to,finish,his,chapter
La,Ramee,went,up,to,him,and,looked,over,his,shoulder,to,see,what,sort,of,a,book,it,was,that,had,so,singular,an,influence,over,the,prisoner,as,to,make,him,put,off,taking,his,dinner
It,was,Caesars,Commentaries,which,La,Ramee,had,lent,him,contrary,to,the,orders,of,the,governor,and,La,Ramee,resolved,never,again,to,disobey,these,injunctions
Meantime,he,uncorked,the,bottles,and,went,to,smell,if,the,pie,was,good
At,halfpast,six,the,duke,arose,and,said,very,gravely,Certainly,Caesar,was,the,greatest,man,of,ancient,times,You,think,so,my,lord,answered,La,Ramee
Yes,Well,as,for,me,I,prefer,Hannibal,And,why,pray,Master,La,Ramee,asked,the,duke
Because,he,left,no,Commentaries,replied,La,Ramee,with,his,coarse,laugh
The,duke,vouchsafed,no,reply,but,sitting,down,at,the,table,made,a,sign,that,La,Ramee,should,seat,himself,opposite
There,is,nothing,so,expressive,as,the,face,of,an,epicure,who,finds,himself,before,a,well,spread,table,so,La,Ramee,when,receiving,his,plate,of,soup,from,Grimaud,presented,a,type,of,perfect,bliss
Zounds,he,said,I,dont,suppose,there,is,a,more,contented,man,at,this,moment,in,all,the,kingdom,than,yourself,You,are,right,my,lord,duke,answered,the,officer,I,dont,know,any,pleasanter,sight,on,earth,than,a,well,covered,table,and,when,added,to,that,he,who,does,the,honors,is,the,grandson,of,Henry,IV,you,will,my,lord,duke,easily,comprehend,that,the,honor,fairly,doubles,the,pleasure,one,enjoys,The,duke,in,his,turn,bowed,and,an,imperceptible,smile,appeared,on,the,face,of,Grimaud,who,kept,behind,La,Ramee
My,dear,La,Ramee,said,the,duke,you,are,the,only,man,to,turn,such,faultless,compliments,No,my,lord,duke,replied,La,Ramee,in,the,fullness,of,his,heart,I,say,what,I,think,there,is,no,compliment,in,what,I,say,to,you,Then,you,are,attached,to,me,asked,the,duke
To,own,the,truth,I,should,be,inconsolable,if,you,were,to,leave,Vincennes,A,droll,way,of,showing,your,affliction,The,duke,meant,to,say,affection,But,my,lord,returned,La,Ramee,what,would,you,do,if,you,got,out
Every,folly,you,committed,would,embroil,you,with,the,court,and,they,would,put,you,into,the,Bastile,instead,of,Vincennes
Now,Monsieur,de,Chavigny,is,not,amiable,I,allow,but,Monsieur,du,Tremblay,is,considerably,worse,Indeed,exclaimed,the,duke,who,from,time,to,time,looked,at,the,clock,the,fingers,of,which,seemed,to,move,with,sickening,slowness
But,what,can,you,expect,from,the,brother,of,a,capuchin,monk,brought,up,in,the,school,of,Cardinal,Richelieu
Ah,my,lord,it,is,a,great,happiness,that,the,queen,who,always,wished,you,well,had,a,fancy,to,send,you,here,where,theres,a,promenade,and,a,tennis,court,good,air,and,a,good,table,In,short,answered,the,duke,if,I,comprehend,you,aright,La,Ramee,I,am,ungrateful,for,having,ever,thought,of,leaving,this,place,Oh
my,lord,duke,tis,the,height,of,ingratitude,but,your,highness,has,never,seriously,thought,of,it,Yes,returned,the,duke,I,must,confess,I,sometimes,think,of,it,Still,by,one,of,your,forty,methods,your,highness,Yes,yes,indeed,My,lord,said,La,Ramee,now,we,are,quite,at,our,ease,and,enjoying,ourselves,pray,tell,me,one,of,those,forty,ways,invented,by,your,highness,Willingly,answered,the,duke,give,me,the,pie,I,am,listening,said,La,Ramee,leaning,back,in,his,armchair,and,raising,his,glass,of,Madeira,to,his,lips,and,winking,his,eye,that,he,might,see,the,sun,through,the,rich,liquid,that,he,was,about,to,taste
The,duke,glanced,at,the,clock
In,ten,minutes,it,would,strike,seven
Grimaud,placed,the,pie,before,the,duke,who,took,a,knife,with,a,silver,blade,to,raise,the,upper,crust,but,La,Ramee,who,was,afraid,of,any,harm,happening,to,this,fine,work,of,art,passed,his,knife,which,had,an,iron,blade,to,the,duke
Thank,you,La,Ramee,said,the,prisoner
this,famous,invention,of,yours,Must,I,tell,you,replied,the,duke,on,what,I,most,reckon,and,what,I,determine,to,try,first,Yes,thats,the,thing,my,lord,cried,his,custodian,gaily
Well,I,should,hope,in,the,first,instance,to,have,for,keeper,an,honest,fellow,like,you,And,you,have,me,my,lord
Well,Having,then,a,keeper,like,La,Ramee,I,should,try,also,to,have,introduced,to,him,by,some,friend,or,other,a,man,who,would,be,devoted,to,me,who,would,assist,me,in,my,flight,Come,come,said,La,Ramee,thats,not,a,bad,idea,Capital,isnt,it

dont,let,us,talk,politics,my,lord,Then,my,keeper,would,begin,to,trust,this,man,and,to,depend,upon,him,and,I,should,have,news,from,those,without,the,prison,walls,Ah,yes
but,how,can,the,news,be,brought,to,you,Nothing,easier,in,a,game,of,tennis,for,example,In,a,game,of,tennis,asked,La,Ramee,giving,more,serious,attention,to,the,dukes,words
Yes,see,I,send,a,ball,into,the,moat,a,man,is,there,who,picks,it,up,the,ball,contains,a,letter
Instead,of,returning,the,ball,to,me,when,I,call,for,it,from,the,top,of,the,wall,he,throws,me,another,that,other,ball,contains,a,letter
Thus,we,have,exchanged,ideas,and,no,one,has,seen,us,do,it,The,devil,it,does
The,devil,it,does,said,La,Ramee,scratching,his,head,you,are,in,the,wrong,to,tell,me,that,my,lord
I,shall,have,to,watch,the,men,who,pick,up,balls,The,duke,smiled

That,we,may,be,more,at,our,ease,La,Ramee,removes,the,guards,keeping,only,Grimaud,to,wait,on,us

The,moment,for,my,escape,is,fixedseven,oclock
Well,at,a,few,minutes,to,seven,At,a,few,minutes,to,seven,cried,La,Ramee,cold,sweat,upon,his,brow
At,a,few,minutes,to,seven,returned,the,duke,suiting,the,action,to,the,words,I,raise,the,crust,of,the,pie,I,find,in,it,two,poniards,a,ladder,of,rope,and,a,gag
I,point,one,of,the,poniards,at,La,Ramees,breast,and,I,say,to,him,My,friend,I,am,sorry,for,it,but,if,thou,stirrest,if,thou,utterest,one,cry,thou,art,a,dead,man,The,duke,in,pronouncing,these,words,suited,as,we,have,said,the,action,to,the,words
He,was,standing,near,the,officer,and,he,directed,the,point,of,the,poniard,in,such,a,manner,close,to,La,Ramees,heart,that,there,could,be,no,doubt,in,the,mind,of,that,individual,as,to,his,determination
Meanwhile,Grimaud,still,mute,as,ever,drew,from,the,pie,the,other,poniard,the,rope,ladder,and,the,gag
La,Ramee,followed,all,these,objects,with,his,eyes,his,alarm,every,moment,increasing

Seven,oclock,said,Grimaud,who,had,not,spoken,a,word
La,Ramee,made,one,movement,in,order,to,satisfy,his,conscience
The,duke,frowned,the,officer,felt,the,point,of,the,poniard,which,having,penetrated,through,his,clothes,was,close,to,his,heart
Let,us,dispatch,said,the,duke

Not,before,me,behind,me,But,with,what,asked,the,duke
With,your,belt,my,lord,replied,La,Ramee
The,duke,undid,his,belt,and,gave,it,to,Grimaud,who,tied,La,Ramee,in,such,a,way,as,to,satisfy,him
La,Ramee,stretched,out,his,legs,Grimaud,took,a,tablecloth,tore,it,into,strips,and,tied,La,Ramees,feet,together
Now,my,lord,said,the,poor,man,let,me,have,the,poire,dangoisse

Two,or,three,chairs,were,thrown,down,as,if,there,had,been,a,struggle
Grimaud,then,took,from,the,pocket,of,the,officer,all,the,keys,it,contained,and,first,opened,the,door,of,the,room,in,which,they,were,then,shut,it,and,doublelocked,it,and,both,he,and,the,duke,proceeded,rapidly,down,the,gallery,which,led,to,the,little,inclosure
At,last,they,reached,the,tennis,court
No,sentinels,no,one,at,any,of,the,windows
The,duke,ran,to,the,rampart,and,perceived,on,the,other,side,of,the,ditch,three,cavaliers,with,two,riding,horses
The,duke,exchanged,a,signal,with,them
It,was,indeed,for,him,that,they,were,there
Grimaud,meantime,undid,the,means,of,escape
This,was,not,however,a,rope,ladder,but,a,ball,of,silk,cord,with,a,narrow,board,which,was,to,pass,between,the,legs,the,ball,to,unwind,itself,by,the,weight,of,the,person,who,sat,astride,upon,the,board
If,I,am,caught,I,risk,nothing,but,being,taken,back,again,to,prison

And,instantly,Grimaud,sitting,upon,the,board,as,if,on,horseback,commenced,his,perilous,descent
The,duke,followed,him,with,his,eyes,with,involuntary,terror
He,had,gone,down,about,threequarters,of,the,length,of,the,wall,when,the,cord,broke
The,duke,uttered,a,cry,but,Grimaud,did,not,give,a,single,moan
He,must,have,been,dreadfully,hurt,for,he,did,not,stir,from,the,place,where,he,fell
Immediately,one,of,the,men,who,were,waiting,slipped,down,into,the,moat,tied,under,Grimauds,shoulders,the,end,of,a,cord,and,the,remaining,two,who,held,the,other,end,drew,Grimaud,to,them
Descend,my,lord,said,the,man,in,the,moat
There,are,only,fifteen,feet,more,from,the,top,down,here,and,the,grass,is,soft,The,duke,had,already,begun,to,descend
His,task,was,the,more,difficult,as,there,was,no,board,to,support,him
He,was,obliged,to,let,himself,down,by,his,hands,and,from,a,height,of,fifty,feet
But,as,we,have,said,he,was,active,strong,and,full,of,presence,of,mind
In,less,than,five,minutes,he,arrived,at,the,end,of,the,cord
He,was,then,only,fifteen,feet,from,the,ground,as,the,gentlemen,below,had,told,him
He,let,go,the,rope,and,fell,upon,his,feet,without,receiving,any,injury
He,instantly,began,to,climb,up,the,slope,of,the,moat,on,the,top,of,which,he,met,De,Rochefort
The,other,two,gentlemen,were,unknown,to,him
Grimaud,in,a,swoon,was,tied,securely,to,a,horse
Gentlemen,said,the,duke,I,will,thank,you,later,now,we,have,not,a,moment,to,lose
those,who,love,me,follow,me,And,he,jumped,on,his,horse,and,set,off,at,full,gallop,snuffing,the,fresh,air,in,his,triumph,and,shouting,out,with,an,expression,of,face,which,it,would,be,impossible,to,describe,Free
free,The,timely,Arrival,of,DArtagnan,in,Paris
At,Blois,DArtagnan,received,the,money,paid,to,him,by,Mazarin,for,any,future,service,he,might,render,the,cardinal

In,turning,the,corner,of,the,Rue,Montmartre,in,order,to,reach,the,Rue,Tiquetonne,and,the,Hotel,de,la,Chevrette,where,he,had,appointed,Porthos,to,meet,him,he,saw,at,one,of,the,windows,of,the,hotel,that,friend,himself,dressed,in,a,skyblue,waistcoat,embroidered,with,silver,and,gaping,till,he,showed,every,one,of,his,white,teeth,whilst,the,people,passing,by,admiringly,gazed,at,this,gentleman,so,handsome,and,so,rich,who,seemed,to,weary,of,his,riches,and,his,greatness
DArtagnan,and,Planchet,had,hardly,turned,the,corner,when,Porthos,recognized,them
Thank,God,you,have,come,Eh

But,to,her,great,surprise,DArtagnan,remained,perfectly,calm,and,instead,of,being,angry,he,laughed,and,said,to,Porthos,Yes,I,understand,the,air,of,La,Rue,Tiquetonne,is,not,like,that,of,Pierrefonds,but,console,yourself,I,will,soon,conduct,you,to,one,much,better,When,will,you,do,that,Immediately,I,hope,Ah
so,much,the,better,To,that,exclamation,of,Porthoss,succeeded,a,groaning,low,and,profound,which,seemed,to,come,from,behind,a,door
DArtagnan,who,had,just,dismounted,then,saw,outlined,against,the,wall,the,enormous,stomach,of,Mousqueton,whose,downdrawn,mouth,emitted,sounds,of,distress
And,you,too,my,poor,Monsieur,Mouston,are,out,of,place,in,this,poor,hotel,are,you,not,asked,DArtagnan,in,that,rallying,tone,which,may,indicate,either,compassion,or,mockery

The,streets,were,crowded,for,it,was,the,day,of,Pentecost,and,the,crowd,looked,in,wonder,at,these,two,cavaliers,one,as,fresh,as,if,he,had,come,out,of,a,bandbox,the,other,so,covered,with,dust,that,he,looked,as,if,he,had,but,just,come,off,a,field,of,battle

On,reaching,the,palace,DArtagnan,sent,to,his,eminence,the,letter,in,which,he,had,been,ordered,to,return,without,delay
He,was,soon,ordered,to,the,presence,of,the,cardinal
Courage,he,whispered,to,Porthos,as,they,proceeded
Believe,me,the,eye,of,the,eagle,is,closed,forever
We,have,only,the,vulture,to,deal,with
Hold,yourself,as,bolt,upright,as,on,the,day,of,the,bastion,of,St,Gervais,and,do,not,bow,too,low,to,this,Italian,that,might,give,him,a,poor,idea,of,you,Good,answered,Porthos
Good,Mazarin,was,in,his,study,working,at,a,list,of,pensions,and,benefices,of,which,he,was,trying,to,reduce,the,number
He,saw,DArtagnan,and,Porthos,enter,with,internal,pleasure,yet,showed,no,joy,in,his,countenance

Welcome,to,ye,Thanks,my,lord

Porthos,turned,his,head,to,the,right,and,to,the,left,and,drew,himself,up,with,a,movement,full,of,dignity
The,best,swordsman,in,the,kingdom,my,lord,said,DArtagnan
Mazarin,was,as,fond,of,fine,soldiers,as,in,later,times,Frederick,of,Prussia,used,to,be
He,admired,the,strong,hands,the,broad,shoulders,and,the,steady,eye,of,Porthos
He,seemed,to,see,before,him,the,salvation,of,his,administration,and,of,the,kingdom,sculptured,in,flesh,and,bone
He,remembered,that,the,old,association,of,musketeers,was,composed,of,four,persons

Fifty,thousand,francs,a,year,said,Porthos
These,were,the,first,words,he,had,spoken
From,pure,zeal,resumed,Mazarin,with,his,artful,smile,from,pure,zeal,and,devotion,then,My,lord,has,perhaps,no,faith,in,those,words,said,DArtagnan
Have,you,Monsieur,le,Gascon,asked,Mazarin,supporting,his,elbows,on,his,desk,and,his,chin,on,his,hands

Now,my,lord,he,would,like,to,have,one,of,his,three,estates,erected,into,a,barony,Only,that,said,Mazarin,his,eyes,twinkling,with,joy,on,seeing,that,he,could,pay,for,Porthoss,devotion,without,opening,his,purse,only,that
That,can,be,managed,I,shall,be,baron,explained,Porthos,stepping,forward
